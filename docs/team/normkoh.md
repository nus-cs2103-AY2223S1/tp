### Project: SoConnect


#### Overview : 

SoConnect is a desktop address book application designed for National University of Singapore (NUS) Computer Science Undergraduates to keep track of their University Social Circle. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.


#### Summary of contributions :

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Code Contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=normkoh&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
- **New Feature**: Added a pie chart to the app.
  - What it does: It integrates with the contact list to provide a visual overview of the user's social network.
  - Justification: This feature improves the product as it provides a convenient way for users to get a sense of the spread and size of their social network without having to scroll through the contact list.
  - Highlights: The implementation of this feature was challenging as it required deep knowledge of how to use javafx, in particular the javafx PieChart class. It was challenging to create a custom PieChart class from the javafx API that can integrate with the data in the contacts list.
  - Credits: One of the methods in the custom PieChart class was reused with minor modifications from [this StackOverflow post](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/35479375)
