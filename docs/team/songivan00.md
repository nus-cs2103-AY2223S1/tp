### Project: CodeConnect

CodeConnect is a specialised task management that can help NUS CS students keep track of their tasks in any modules and is linked to their local contacts to find students that take the same modules. This gives them an easy way to source for help within each module.  The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
