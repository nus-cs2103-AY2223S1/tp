# Project: ConnectNUS

## Overview
ConnectNUS is a desktop address book application used for NUS CS students to keep track of their own modules, and their friend's modules and contacts as well. This is to facilitate NUS CS students to keep track of their friends to work with so that they can easily find friends to collaborate with.

## Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Undo
  * What it does: Allows users to erase their last action.
  * Justification: To be able to reverse a mistake made by the user, such as deleting a contact.


* **New Feature**: Redo
  * What it does: Allows users to restore any action that was previously undone by the Undo command.
  * Justification: To be able to reverse an accidental undo made by the user.

* **New Feature**: Next Semester Command
  * What it does: Moves all current modules to become previous modules for the user and all contacts.
