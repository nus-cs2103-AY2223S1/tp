### Project: MyInsuRec

*MyInsuRec* is a desktop app for financial advisors to manage and organize their clients and meetings, helping
financial advisors stay connected with their clients. *MyInsuRec* is best suited for the quick typist, as it is
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), with all the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
Given below are my contributions to the project.
