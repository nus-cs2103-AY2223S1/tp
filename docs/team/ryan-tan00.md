### Project: CS2103 tP

#### Overview

checkUp is a desktop patient medical record management system. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI 
created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 15 kLoC.

#### Summary of contributions

##### Code contributed

[RepoSense report](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ryan-tan00&breakdown=true)

##### Enhancements implemented

* Get patients by their patient type: `get /inp` & `get /outp`
  * Description: Filters patients by their patient type (inpatient & outpatient)
  * Justification: Easier for hospital staff to identify which patients are staying in the hospital

* Get the past appointments of patients: `get /appt`
  * Description: Obtains all past appointments of a specified patient
  * Justification: Hospital staff can view the medical history of a patient

* Implemented sorting for past appointments
  * Description: Past appointments will be arranged from the most recent to oldest when added to the list of past 
                 appointments
  * Justification: Instead of sorting appointments by date whenever `get /appt` is called, sorting the appointments as 
                   it is added makes it more efficient as we foresee more `get /appt` commands than `appt` commands

* Implemented the ability to click on patients in the person list panel
  * Description: Clicking on a person card in the person list panel updates their details on the person view panel
  * Justification: Easier access to patient's details, rather than typing in the `view` command

##### Contributions to the UG

* Added documentation for `get /inp` & `get /outp`
* Added documentation for `edit`
* Added 'restrictions' column to the table for `add` and `edit` command
* Added a `get` command summary table

##### Contributions to the DG

* Added documentation for `get /inp` & `get /outp`
  * Created a sequence diagram for `get /inp` to illustrate how the `Logic` component executes a `get /inp` command
* Added documentation for `get /appt`
* Edited `Logic` component to reflect the logic flow of `GetCommand`
* Edited `get` command implementation
  * Edited overarching Sequence Diagrams for `get` command (only prefix & prefix + parameters)
  * Edited `get /appton` implementation to fit the format of other `get` command implementations
* Add use cases for `get /inp`, `get /outp`, `get /appt` and sorting of appointments when added

##### Contributions to team-based tasks
