### Project: FoodWhere

**FoodWhere is a desktop application for managing your food stall addresses and reviews.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

FoodWhere is written in Java, with about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**
  * Implemented `Rating` class, which adds a rating for a `Review` for critics to rate a stall from 0 to 5 inclusive. ([#151](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/151)) 
  * Implemented copying of `Stall` and `Review` data onto the computer clipboard, which enables the user to right-click on either a `Stall` or `Review` to copy the name, address, or any other information such as tags to the system clipboard. ([#169](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/169), [#237](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/237))
    * Justification: This feature allows the user to easily edit the content without typing out the entire review if the data is very long into the command text box.
* **Enhancements to Graphical User Interface (GUI)**
  * Modified user interface to have two separate lists for `Stall` and `Review`. ([#46](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/46), [#82](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/82), [#88](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/88), [#99](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/99), [#126](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/126), [#138](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/138), [#162](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/162))
    * In the Stall list, the `name`, `address`, and `tags` of the Stall are listed.
    * In the Review list, the `name` of stall, `address` of stall, `date` of visit, review `content`, `rating` and `tags` are listed.
    * For `ratings` in `Review`, each rating is represented by a star which allows for quick visualisation.
  * Justification:
    * This enhancement is important as all other features implemented must be reflected correctly in both the stall list and review list.
* **Enhancements to existing features**
  * Refactoring `Address`, `Name` and `Tag` into `model.commons` package. ([#119](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/119), [#224](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/224))
  * Justification:
    * Refactoring these fields into their own common packages helped to reduce confusion as all these fields are shared by both `Stall` and `Review`, and hence, they should be in a common package rather than situated in either `model.stall` or `model.review`.
* **Enhancements to new features**
  * Added error messages for any missing mandatory fields in RAddCommand and SAddCommand. ([#216](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/pull/216))

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* **Enhancements to validation checks and error messages**
  * Ensured that all validation checks and exceptions are handled properly.
  * Ensured that all error messages shown to the user upon execution of an incorrect command or missing fields are correct and easy to understand, so that the user can recover from any errors and continue using the application.
