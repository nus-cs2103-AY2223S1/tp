### Project: Yellow Pages

Yellow Pages is a desktop address book application used for students in universities. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * **Search Contacts By Tags**
      * *Description*: Filters contacts which contains the corresponding tag.
      * *Justification*: Search by contacts is a function that supports our idea of building an application which helps
    university students organize their contacts.
      * *Highlights*: This function was implemented similar to Find Command in the original Address Book. 
      * *Credits*: Find Command
  * **Add Person to Meeting**
    * *Description*: Allows users to add existing contacts to existing meetings.
    * *Justification*: This function would make it much more convenient for users to update the persons in their meetings 
instead of deleting and recreating the meeting everytime any details needs to be updated.
  * **Delete Person from Meeting**
    * *Description*: Allows users to delete contacts from existing meetings.
    * *Justification*: This function would make it much more convenient for users to update the persons in their meetings

    * *Justification*: This function would make it much more convenient for users to update their meeting details
      instead of deleting and recreating the meeting everytime any details needs to be updated.
