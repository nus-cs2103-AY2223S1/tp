### Project: Yellow Pages

Yellow Pages is a desktop address book application used for students in universities. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:

      * *Justification*: Search by contacts is a function that supports our idea of building an application which helps
    university students organize their contacts.

      * *Credits*: Find Command
  * **Add Person to Meeting**
    * *Description*: Allows users to add existing contacts to existing meetings.

instead of deleting and recreating the meeting everytime any details needs to be updated.

    * *Description*: Allows users to delete contacts from existing meetings.
