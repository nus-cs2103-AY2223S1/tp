### Project: YellowBook

YellowBook is for university students who are involved in many projects and have to organize their project contacts and tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented tags and the tag list.
  * What it does: Each tag has a name and a count of how many contacts/tasks are associated with it. The tag list displays all the user's tags.
  * Justification: Users of YellowBook need a way to organise their contacts and tasks into the respective projects that they belong to. 
    This supports other functionalities such as filter to allow users to access the relevant contacts/tasks when working on 
    a particular project.
  * Highlights: Duplicate tags cannot be added to the tag list.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add/delete tags from contacts/tasks. [#113](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/113) [#135](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/135) [#166](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/166) [#123](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/123)
  * What it does: allows the user to add/delete tags from contacts/tasks.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to label
  people/tasks with the context of which project it belongs to. This allows the user to look for contacts/tasks from a
  specific project without having to look through the entire list.
  * Highlights: This enhancement required me to set up an entirely new Tag class and a unique list of Tags that 
  responded dynamically to user input, in addition to the commands themselves. It required an in-depth analysis of 
  design alternatives. The implementation was challenging as I had to consider how to support adding tags to 
  both contacts and tasks concurrently.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to list all existing tags. [#177](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/pull/177)
