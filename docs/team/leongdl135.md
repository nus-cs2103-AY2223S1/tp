### Project: ProfNUS

ProfNUS is a **desktop application which helps SOC Professors who have many modules with many students/TAs to manage.** It is optimized for users who prefer CLI over GUI so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
