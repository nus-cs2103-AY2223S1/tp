## Overview
ConnectNUS is a desktop address book application used for NUS CS students to keep track of their own modules, and their friend's modules and contacts as well. This is to facilitate NUS CS students to keep track of their friends to work with so that they can easily find friends to collaborate with.

## Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add lesson
  * What it does: Adds lessons (lab, lecture, tutorial and recitation) to a person or the user.
  * Justification: To keep track of yours and your friends' lessons so that de-conflicting schedules is easier.


* **New Feature**: Timetable
  * What it does: View user's or person's timetable for the week (with the lessons added).
  * Justification: Easily arrange meetings by viewing everyone's schedule to find their free time.
