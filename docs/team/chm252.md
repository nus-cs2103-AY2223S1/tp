### Project: Mass Linkers

Mass Linkers is a powerful Desktop application tool that provides a centralised platform for Computer Science (CS) students to find study support from batchmates with common modules. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### New Enhancements: find: (Pull requests [\#75](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/75), [\#82](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/82))
* What it does: Find batchmates by their Telegram, GitHub, emails or phone numbers, with partially matching text input.
* Justification: It provides greater convenience to the users as they are not limited to finding based on names. Being able to find Telegram handles, GitHub usernames, emails and phone numbers with partially matching text input is reasonable as these items are unique to individuals. 
* Highlights:
  * Implemented `containsPartialWordIgnoreCase` method in `StringUtil` to allow the finding of items with partially matching text.
  * Included test cases for `containsPartialWordIgnoreCase` in `StringUtilTest`.

#### New Enhancements: duplicate add and edit prevention: (Pull requests [\#207](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/207))
* What it does: Users may now add/edit to names that already exists in the Mass Linkers!
* Justification: Allowing identical names to coexist fits into the reality that people can share the same name. But Telegram handles, GitHub usernames, emails and phone numbers should be unique.
* Highlights:
  * Updated `isSameStudent` in `Student` class.

#### New Feature: Mod Find (Pull requests [\#101](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/101))
* What it does: Finds and lists batchmates who have taken or are taking certain module(s).
* Justification: It allows users to effortlessly know the batchmates who have taken or are taking certain module(s).
* Highlights:
  * Implemented `ModFindCommand` to handle finding of batchmates who have taken or are taking certain module(s)
  * Modified `ModCommandParser` to parse `mod find` command arguments.
  * Built test cases in `ModFindCommandTest` for `ModFindCommand`.
  * Included `mod find` parser tests in `ModCommandParserTest`.
  * Implemented `ModContainsKeywordsPredicate` to support module finding.

#### New Feature: Mod Find Taken/Taken (Pull requests [\#132](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp/pull/132))
* What it does: Finds and lists batchmates who have taken/are taking certain module(s).
* Justification: It allows users to effortlessly know the batchmates who have taken/are taking certain module(s).
* Highlights:
  * Modified `ModCommandParser` to parse `mod find taken` and `mod find taking` command arguments.
  * Included `mod find taken` and `mod find taking` parser tests in `ModCommandParserTest`.
  * Implemented `ModTakenContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `ModTakingContainsKeywordsPredicate` to support this feature.
