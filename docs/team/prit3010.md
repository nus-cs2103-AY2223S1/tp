### Project: Coydir

**Coydir is a desktop application used by Human Resource Executives to streamline processes in managing their staffing.** The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Code Contributed

#### Enhancements Implemented
* **New Features**
  * Implemented `batch-add` feature.
    * Created a `BatchAddCommand` class to handle the logic (Refer to code [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/coydir/logic/commands/BatchAddCommand.java)) 
    and `BatchAddCommandParser` class to handle the parsing of the user input (Refer to code [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/coydir/logic/parser/BatchAddCommandParser.java)).
    * Use Case: User can add multiple employees at once if they have the data in the form of a `.csv` file.
    * Why: Without this command, users will have to manually input each employee using an add command. 
    This is especially troublesome when the user has to transfer their database over or if there has been a 
    recruitment cycle and they have multiple employees joining.
    * Constraints: This implementation was rather difficult as it was rather different from all the commands 
    implemented before. Moreover, having to read from an external file made it a bit more difficult to test. 
    One functionality of this feature is that if there is any error, the command will be aborted 
    and the database will be reverted to previous state. This was a bit more tricky as the functions 
    only returned `ReadOnlyDatabase`. Therefore, I had to find a workaround for that.
  * Implemented `Leave` class
    * Created the `Leave` class one of the key components we are tracking in our application.
    * Use Case: Building blocks to track stuff like leaves taken so far, whether employee is on leave etc.
    * Why: Tracking Leaves is one of the more important components of HRM.
    * Constraints: Was not too difficult other than the part about writing into `JSON Adapted Person`. 
     which was slightly more complicated as I had to make sure that the Priority Queue of the `Leave` will 
    be stored in the `database.json`.
  

* **Existing Features**
  * Removed all instances of `AddressBook` and changed it to `Database`.
  * Fixed multiple bugs (Refer to #120, #138, #142).
