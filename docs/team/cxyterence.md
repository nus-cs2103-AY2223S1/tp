### Project: Teacher’s Address Book (TAB)

Teacher’s Address Book (TAB) is a **desktop app made for teachers, teaching assistants(TA) and professors for managing
contacts of each other, as well as their students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TAB can get your contact management tasks
done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the `Position` class
  * What it does: Abstract class to facilitate implementation of `Student`, `TeachingAssistant` and `Professor` classes,
    which serve to encapsulate relevant details of students, teaching assistants and professors respectively.
  * Highlights: The `Student`, `TeachingAssistant` and `Professor` classes extend the abstract `Position` class.
    Being the first subclass of `Position` to be implemented, the design of the `TeachingAssistant` class provided a
    guideline for the implementation of the other two subclasses (i.e. `Student` class and `Professor` class).
* **New Feature**: Added `ShowCommand` class
  * What it does: Allows the user to display additional details of a specific `Person`. For instance, `grades` and
    `attendance` will be displayed for `Student`, `availability` will be displayed for `TeachingAssistant`, and `roles`
    will be displayed for `Professor`.
  * Highlights: Displays the aforementioned details in a secondary panel beside the primary panel that displays the list
    of `Persons`, thus keeping the primary panel compact.
* **New Feature**: Changed the UI of TAB
  * Highlights: The primary panel now displays key information like name, position and tag. On the other hand, the theme
    is now more aesthetically pleasing and simple to the eye.
