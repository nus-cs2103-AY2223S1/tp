### Project: Swift+

Swift+ is a **project management application** designed to help software engineering (SWE) project leads in tracking their daily interactions with contacts. The user interacts with Swift+ mainly through a Command Line Interface (CLI). The application is written in **Java** and has about **10k LoC**.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
