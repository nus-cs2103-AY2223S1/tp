### Project: Plannit

**Plannit** is an **all-in-one application** that streamlines the execution of module
deliverables by **empowering NUS students** with the ability to manage **tasks**, **links** and
**module-mates** (i.e., students in the same module) to increase their productivity.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Adding, deleting and opening of `Link` objects
  * What it does: Allows students to add module-specific link(s) with a user-defined alias. 
    Multiple links can be opened using a single command.
  * Justification: This feature provides a centralised storage location for their links, which 
    in turn empowers them with easy access to online resources at any given point of time.
  * Highlights: This is a completely new component that was not previously
    in the design of AB3. It serves as a bridge between the students' module needs and the internet

* **New Feature**: Interactive UI for `Link` objects
  * What it does: Allows students to open links from the application window by clicking
    on the displayed alias associated with the desired link.
  * Justification: This feature provides them with easy access to online resources 
    at any given point of time with a single click.
  * Highlights: This is a completely new component that was not previously
    in the design of AB3. It has the effect of making each link object look visually distinct
    while having the benefit of being functional.

* **Code contributed [coming soon]**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=shwene&breakdown=true)

* **Documentation**
    * User Guide:
      * Added documentation for commands `add-link`, `delete-link` and
      `open-link` (e.g, [#51](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/51) and
        [#167](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/167))
    * Developer Guide:
      * Added implementation detail of `Link` components
      (see [#89](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/89))

* **Review contributions**:
    * Reviewed numerous PRs (e.g., [#36](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/36),
      and [#95](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/95)) 

* **Contributions beyond the project team**:
    * Sent 6 bug [reports](https://github.com/shwene/ped/issues) 
      in [MassLinkers](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T11-4/tp) during
      the practical exam dry run.
