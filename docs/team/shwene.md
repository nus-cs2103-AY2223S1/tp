### Project: Plannit 1.1

Plannit is a desktop application used to help NUS CS
students who are furious typists to manage their academic
details. This application will be the go-to platform for
fast-typers to access all module links and information
without needing to tediously navigate through multiple
websites.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
