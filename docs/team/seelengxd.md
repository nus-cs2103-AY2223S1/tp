### Project: ArtBuddy

ArtBuddy (AB) a desktop application that helps commission-based artists manage their customers, commissions, and artworks easily. Written in Java, ArtBuddy is primarily optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), but also comes with a GUI created using JavaFX. It has about 14 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Key Contribution:** Added the `Commission` model [#68](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/68)
  * What it does:
    * Created classes for Commissions and its attributes.
    * Integrated them with `Storage`.
    * Added all initial `Commission` CRUD methods to `AddressBook` and `ModelManager` to act as the initial convenient interface to use for all commission-related commands.
    * Integrated the `Commission` list into the UI.
  * Justification:
    * This was a prerequisite to all commission-related commands that we wanted to implement.
  * Highlights:
    * This enhancement was one of the first code-related PRs and required working with three components (`Ui`, `Model`, `Storage`).
      It ended up being quite huge and challenging, requiring a good understanding of many components to implement it without breaking existing abstractions.

* **New feature:** Added Commission Commands [~~C~~RUD]
  * Added `editcom` [#109](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/109)
  * Added `delcom` [#68](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/68)
  * Added `opencom` [#91](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/pull/91)
  * What it does: Adds read, update and delete functionality for commissions.
  * Justification: Commissions are a core feature of our application and hence all its CRUD functionality are necessary for our product.
