### Project: CLIMods


`CLIMods` is a native desktop application for NUS students to explore, manage and plan academic
modules that they are interested in taking. Power users of the command line/terminal will be able to
plan and manage their modules much faster than doing it on [nusmods.com](https://nusmods.com).

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find modules starting with the same `[department code]`

  * What it does: Allows users to find the modules offered in NUS under the same department
  * Justification: The feature provides the user with the ability to view modules under the same department.
  This is beneficial for users who want to find out the modules offered under the same department. In particular,
  users who are planning their major requirement may use this to search for potential modules to take.
  * Highlights: The feature is case-insensitive and differentiates against department codes that are share the same prefix.


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=seeksaveserve&breakdown=true)


* **Project management**:

  * Facilitated meetings and task management
  * Took down meeting minutes


* **Enhancements to existing features**:

  * Implemented storage for `add` and `delete` commands (Pull requests [\#82](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/pull/82))

  * Wrote additional tests for `add` and `delete` to increase coverage from 28.88% to 30.86% (Pull requests [\#82](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/pull/82))
  
  * Implemented UI for all lesson types under the `view` command (Pull requests [\#100](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/pull/100))


* **Documentation**:

  * User Guide:

    * Added warnings and notes to highlight potential confusions users might have (Pull requests [\#166](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/pull/166))
    
  * Developer Guide:

    * Updated MSS for `find`, `add`. (Pull request [\#169](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/pull/169) )
    * Proofread the Developer Guide


* **Community**:

  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#12](), [\#32](), [\#19](), [\#42]()

  * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [1](), [2](), [3](), [4]())

  * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (examples: [1](), [2](), [3]())

  * Some parts of the history feature I added was adopted by several other class mates ([1](), [2]())
