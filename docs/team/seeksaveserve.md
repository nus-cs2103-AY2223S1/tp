### Project: CLIMods


`CLIMods` is a native desktop application for NUS students to explore, manage and plan academic
modules that they are interested in taking. Power users of the command line/terminal will be able to
plan and manage their modules much faster than doing it on [nusmods.com](https://nusmods.com).

Given below are my contributions to the project.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to find modules starting with the same `[department code]`

  * What it does: Allows users to find the modules offered in NUS under the same department
  * Justification: The feature provides the user with the ability to view modules under the same department.
  This is beneficial for users who want to find out the modules offered under the same department. In particular,
  users who are planning their major requirement may use this to search for potential modules to take.
  * Highlights: The feature is case-insensitive and differentiates against department codes that are share the same prefix.
