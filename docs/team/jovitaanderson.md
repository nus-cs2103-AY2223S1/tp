### Project: FinBook

FinBook is a desktop app for Financial Assistant (FA) to manage their client details and ensure that your data is
secured. With FinBook, you can set a unique password, manage and view client's details, meetings and portfolio as well
as many other features to make your daily workflow much more efficient!

### Overview

FinBook is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), which means most of our commands are done by typing.

### Summary of Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code
  contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jovitaanderson&breakdown=true)


* **Features implemented**:
    * **New feature**: Copy command
        * What it does: allows the user to copy the client information and portfolio in text to the user's
          clipboard and can be pasted anywhere.
        * Justification: This feature improves the functionality of FinBook as Financial Advisors spent the
          majority of their time communication with clients through messaging apps or emails. With this feature
          users are able to efficiently copy and paste their planned anywhere for easier communication with their
          clients.
    * **New feature**: Add Light/Dark mode option
        * What it does: allows the user to have the option to set FinBook to be light/dark mode
    * **Enhance feature**: Allow multiple deletion of clients
        * What is does: allows the user to delete multiple clients through one command.
        * Justification: Current implementation only allowed deletion of one client, which is not time efficient
          when the need for deleting multiple clients is needed since Financial Advisors will have multiple clients
          stored.
        * Highlights: Several ways of using the `delete` command have been implemented to ensure that users can
          find the best command to delete a specific set of clients. The several ways include: `delete [INDEX]`,
          ,`delete [INDEX1], [INDEX2] ,...`, `delete [START INDEX] - [END INDEX]`, `delete all`
    * **Update feature**: Add client to include income and meeting time attribute
        * What is does: allow the user to add income and meeting time(optional) to the client
        * Justification: Important information the Financial Advisors take note of when engaging a client is their
          income and next potential meeting date. Hence, these attributes have been added to store these details in
        * FinBook.
        * Highlight: Meeting date is made optional because there could be instances where a meeting date has not been
          settled among the user and client.

    * **User Guide**:
        * Add FinBook's product description.
        * Add legend for symbol and icons used throughout user guide.
        * Add a description and purpose of FinBook's User Interface components.
        * Add explanation of command format of FinBook's CLI

    * **Developer Guide**:

        * Update user stories
        * Add test cases for deleting a client
