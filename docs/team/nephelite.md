### Project: TaskBook

TaskBook is a desktop address book and task assignment application for NUS students to efficiently manage their contacts and tasks.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**:
  * `task sort` ([#144](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/144), [#176](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/176))
    * What it does: Adds support to sort tasks alphabetically, by when they were added, or by their date.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to gather information about a task in their list at a quick glance.
    * Highlights: Each sorting command is a different type, and inherit from an abstract superclass `TaskSortCommand`, thus exhibiting polymorphism and inheritance.
  * `task find` ([#161](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/161))
    * What it does: Adds support to filter tasks by a query, their assignment, or their done status.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to gather information about a task in their list at a quick glance.
    * Highlights: There are many fields that users can find tasks by, so the method to find tasks could have been long. Instead, there are over a dozen smaller private methods that make up this method, thus exhibiting SLAP.
  * `contact sort` ([#174](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/174), [#176](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/176))
    * What it does: Adds support to sort contacts alphabetically, or by when they were added.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to gather information about a contact in their list at a quick glance.
    * Highlights: Each sorting command is a different type, and inherit from an abstract superclass `ContactSortCommand`, thus exhibiting polymorphism and inheritance.
  * `contact find` ([#171](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/171))
    * What it does: Adds support to find contacts by a query.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to gather information about a contact in their list at a quick glance.
  * TaskListPanel ([#99](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/99))
    * What it does: Adds Gui component that displays tasks added to Task Book, after applying filters from find commands, and sorted by sort commands.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to gather information about a task in their list at a quick glance.
