### Project: GREWZ

GREWZ is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add pictures into the application.
  * What it does: allows the user to select a .jpg file and upload it into the application as a student picture.
  * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because it addresses the user's needs to help them recognise students easier.
  * Highlights: This enhancement adds an image of the students in the UI. The implementation was challenging as it required understanding of JavaFX file chooser and its usage.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to create Assignments.
  * What it does: allows the user to add Assignments into their task list. An assignment is a type of task that allows the user to keep track of students who have and have not submitted an assignment.
  * Justification: this feature improves the product by enabling users to monitor their student's work progress.
  * Highlights: Students can be added and removed from the assignment using the edit-task command. It required careful consideration over other design implementations, but due to time constraints a simple one was chosen for now.

  * Refactoring of Address to StudentId, and adding tests for validation of StudentId which also increased coverage by 0.26% (Pull request [\#58](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/58))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the adding assignment feature  [\#193](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/193)
