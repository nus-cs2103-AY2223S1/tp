### Project: GREWZ

GREWZ is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add pictures into the application.
  * What it does: allows the user to select a .jpg file and upload it into the application as a student picture.
  * Justification: this feature improves the product significantly because it addresses the user's needs to help them recognise students easier.
  * Highlights: This enhancement adds an image of the students in the UI. The implementation was challenging as it required understanding of JavaFX file chooser and its usage.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to create Assignments.
  * What it does: allows the user to add Assignments into their task list. An assignment is a type of task that allows the user to keep track of students who have and have not submitted an assignment.
  * Justification: this feature improves the product by enabling users to monitor their student's work progress.
  * Highlights: Students can be added and removed from the assignment using the edit-task command. It required careful consideration over other design implementations, but due to time constraints a simple one was chosen for now.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=zzthian&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Updated the GUI color scheme for Tasks in the TaskList (Pull request [\#122](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/122))
  * Refactoring of Address to StudentId, and adding tests for validation of StudentId which also increased coverage by 0.26% (Pull request [\#58](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/58))

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for the adding assignment feature  [\#193](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/193)
    * Rectify minor documentation issues identified by other users: [\#205](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/205)
    * Change language to suit GREWZ compared to original AB3 [\#40](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/40)
    * Elaborate on example commands for clearer instructions [\#226](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/226)
  * Developer Guide:
    * Added implementation and use cases for Upload Picture Command [\#122](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/122)
    * Update class diagrams to include new types of tasks

* **Community**:
  * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#60](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/60), [\#81](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/81)
