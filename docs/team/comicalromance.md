### Project: StudMap

StudMap is a lightweight desktop application that addresses your needs of managing the student 
records across multiple spreadsheets. Using a CLI (Command Line Interface) approach, we mitigate
the need for teaching assistants to navigate through convoluted menus and buttons when keeping 
track of the administrative details for the students. It is written in Java with the GUI implemented 
using JavaFX. <br>
