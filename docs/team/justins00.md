### Project: PleaseHireUs

PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a desktop app for managing internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PHU can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.Given below are my contributions to the project
* **New Feature**: A reminder bar (Pull requests [\#94](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/94))
  * What it does: Shows the number of upcoming internship interviews, assessments or pending offers.
  * Justification: Remind users of upcoming internships process so that users are able to prepare for them.
