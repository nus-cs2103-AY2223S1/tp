### Project: GuestBook

GuestBook is a **desktop app for managing guests in a hotel,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you are a hotel manager who can type fast, GuestBook can get your
guest management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.
This project is based off AddressBook - Level 3.
