### Project: PleaseHireUs

PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a desktop app for managing internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PHU can get your internship 
management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the `Position` field
    * What it does: allows the user to record an internship position 
  (Pull request [\#26](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/26)).
    * Justification: Knowing the role one has applied for is important to identify the skills required for the job. 
  This feature improves the product significantly as it can easily remind user which role he has applied for during the
  internship application. 
    * Highlights: This addition affects existing commands and many test cases needed to be changed.
* **New Feature**: Added the `Date` field
    * What it does: allows the user to record the date of the internship application deadline 
  (Pull request [\#26](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/26)).
    * Justification: Important dates (such as interview dates, test dates, etc.) are crucial components of an internship
  application. This feature improves the product significantly not only because it reminds the user about important
  dates, but also because it helps prevent any schedule clashes.
    * Highlights: This addition affects existing commands and many test cases needed to be changed.
* **New Feature**: Added the `ApplicationProcess` field
    * What it does: allows the user to record the current state of the internship application process
  (Pull request [\#26](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/26)).
    * Justification: Knowing which stage of application one is currently at is important to prepare accordingly. This
  feature improves the product significantly since it reminds the user which stage of the application they are currently at.
    * Highlights: This addition affects existing commands and many test cases needed to be changed.

* **New Feature**: Added the `Website` field
    * What it does: allows the user to record the website containing the details for the internship 
  (Pull request [\#26](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/26)).
    * Justification: To allow user to easily access more details about the internship, if there is any.
    * Highlights: This addition affects existing commands and many test cases needed to be changed.
* **New Feature**: Added keyboard shortcuts for the help window
    * What it does: allows the user to close the help window and copy the user guide url link without any mouse usage
    (Pull request [\#141](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/pull/141)).
    * Justification: As an app that is optimized for use via CLI, we strive to minimize the need of a mouse to reduce the 
  number of switches between keyboard and mouse.
