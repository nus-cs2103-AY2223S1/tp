### Project: `CLIMods`

`CLIMods` is a native desktop application for NUS students to explore, manage and plan academic
modules that they are interested in taking. Power users of the command line/terminal will be able to
plan and manage their modules much faster than doing it on [nusmods.com](https://nusmods.com).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view the user guide via the `help` command.
    * What it does: Show our website in a window via the `help` command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing the user to easily access the documentation
        on our website.  This is better than reading a text file because the documentation is well-formatted and
        includes pictures.
    * Highlights: The documentation accessed through the application prevents the user from accessing websites from
        other domains.  This is because we want the user to use it for reading the user guide or other pages on our
        website, rather than as an internet browser.
