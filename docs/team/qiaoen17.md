### Project: SETA

SETA is a desktop application for CS2103T Teaching Assistants to track their students’ and tutorials’ details, and
questions asked by students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SETA enables you to manage your tutorials and track your students
more effectively than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to record student's total response count for all tutorials
    * What it does: allows user to add/update the student's response count
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the user needs to track student's response count
      to grade student participation.
    * Highlights: This implementation required me to alter existing classes to implement the feature.
    * Credits:

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark a tutorial as done
    * What it does: allows user to update the status of the tutorial as complete
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as users may have multiple tutorial groups, and the
      feature allows them to update which tutorials are incomplete.
    * Highlights: The implementation was tricky, I had to discuss with my members the parameters of the function, if it
      should have just the index of the tutorial in the tutorial list, or the date and time as well as the tutorial
      number.
    * Credits:

* **New Feature**: Added the ability for users to view a list of tutorials added
    * What it does: allows users to see all the tutorials they have added
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly as the user is a busy person and needs to view all
      his tutorials to track which are still incomplete.
    * Highlights: The implementation is quite hard with the GUI
