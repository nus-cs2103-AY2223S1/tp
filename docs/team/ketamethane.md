### Project: SETA

SETA is a desktop application for CS2103T Teaching Assistants to track their students’ and tutorials’ details, and
questions asked by students, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SETA enables you to manage your tutorials and track your students
more effectively than traditional GUI apps. Given below are my contributions to the project.

**New Feature**: Added the ability to add a question.

* What it does: allows the user to add a question raised by a student during a Zoom session into the list of
  questions.
* Justification: This feature enables the user to keep track of the list of questions raised by students to address
  them. This is used especially when the user does not have time to answer the question during the tutorial or
  if he needs to clarify the content with the professor before answering the question.
* Highlights: The implementation requires the addition of a new class (Question).

**New Feature**: Added the ability to mark a question.

* What it does: allows the user to mark a question raised by a student during a Zoom session as important.
* Justification: This feature enables the user to prioritise which questions to address first. Such questions could be
  important or requires an urgent response.
* Highlights: The implementation requires the addition of a new class (ImportantTag).

**New Feature**: Added the ability to unmark a question.

* What it does: allows the user to mark a question raised by a student during a Zoom session as unimportant.
* Justification: This feature enables the user to undo the action of accidentally marking a particular question as
  important.
* Highlights: The implementation requires the addition of a new class (ImportantTag).

**New Feature**: Added the ability to delete a question.

* What it does: allows the user to delete a question in the list of questions.
* Justification: This feature enables the user to keep track of the list of questions raised by students to address
  them, removing the questions he has already answered.
