### Project EzLead

EZLead is an **app made for tech leads to manage teams**, the main defining feature is that it uses CLI commands coupled with a gui interface.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New feature** Implemented userlist command which opens a new window to show all users in the company. ([Commit](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/commit/a8959c6b74bebe8c3b1192f7b3125472921a71f1)).

* **New feature** Created all new GUI components(TeamList, TaskList, Progress Bar, User list) ([\#117](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/pull/117)).
* **Enhancements Done**:
  * Implemented task progress bar and integrated it to work with team task list(Pull request [\#148](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/pull/148)).
      * What it does: Allows tech lead to see how many tasks are done and not done.
      * Justification: Tech leads may want to see how well a team is faring in terms of task progerss and if they are lacking behind.
  * Wrote test cases for mark task command (Pull request [\#169](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/issues/169)).
