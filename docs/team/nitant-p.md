### Project: SoConnect

### Overview

SoConnect is a desktop address book application designed for National University of Singapore (NUS) Computer Science Undergraduates to keep track of their University Social Circle. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Added the ability to find contacts by any field and added a new search mode.
      
  * What it does: allows the user to find and filter contacts by any field used in our program.

  * Justification: Previously, the find command only supported the `name` field. This reduces the usefulness of the find command. There are many use cases, as listed in the Developer Guide, to search by other fields.

  * Highlights: Its implementation was done in a way to make it as extendable as possible as our team was constantly adding new fields to contacts. The main logic consisted of a single class that implemented the `Predicate` interface which encapsulated all the filters. To support `OR` and `ALL` search mode for some fields, efficiency and practicality was a factor in deciding its implementation before settling on set operations and the Java `Set` collection.


  * Wrote additional test cases for existing features to increase coverage from 57.02% to 65.06% [#192](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W08-3/tp/pull/192).
