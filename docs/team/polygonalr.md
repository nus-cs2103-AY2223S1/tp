# Rapportbook

Financial advisors (FA) rely on a large client base for their job. Rapportbook helps new FAs be effective in managing and engaging their clients, by solving the following problems:
- Inefficient use of time
- Motivational issues
- Tracking information about clients
- Hard to promote success status online

Given below are my contributions to the project.
