### Project: MODPRO

MODPRO is a desktop application which helps NUS students in tracking the progress of their modules. It is highly optimised for students who prefer Command Line Interface (CLI) by allowing those who type fast to key in commands to track their modules. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:  Implemented `AddTagCommand`
    * What it does: Adds the tag to a task in the task list.
    * Justification: This feature allows users to add priority status or deadline to their task so
      that they can track the priority and deadline to complete the task.
    * Highlights: The implementation for `AddTagCommand` was slightly challenging  as there were several cases
      such the task already having the tag that needs to be considered. Moreover, given that the various tags added
      interact with the `Task` classes when being added, some changes in `Task` methods have to be made.


* **New Feature**: Implemented `LinkExamCommand` which allows users to link a task in the task list to an exam in the 
exam list.

* **New Feature**: Partially implemented `AddModuleCommand` which allows users to add modules to the module list.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the `EditTagCommand` which allows users to edit the tags linked to the task.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the `DeleteTagCommand` which allows users to delete the tags linked to the task.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the `SortTaskCommand` which allows users to sort the tasks stored in the task list.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=dlimyy)


* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.3.0` and `v1.3.1` on GitHub

        * Updated the `Quick Start` portion of the UG to reflect change in application to `MODPRO`.
    * Developer Guide:
        * Added implementation details of `SortTaskCommand` and `LinkExamCommand`
        * Added numerous use cases and user stories
