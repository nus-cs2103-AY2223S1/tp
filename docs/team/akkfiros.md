### Project: NutriGoals

NutriGoals is a command-line interface, desktop app that facilitates users' plans to adopt a healthier lifestyle.
Targeted at NUS students specifically, it primarily serves as a nutritional tracker that is free-to-use unlike other
similar products in the market. Moreover, NutriGoals boasts other useful features that enhance user experience and convenience.
With NutriGoals, you can work towards your fitness goals hassle-free and free-of-charge!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: TipCommand (PR #87 and #94)
  * What it does: It provides a tip to users to assist them on their fitness journey
  * Justification: This product aims to assist users in their journey to adopting healthier lifestyles. This feature provides NUS-specific tips to help users should they feel stuck and not know how to proceed. It is also able to inspire users to do things differently should they feel bored with the same routine.
  * Highlights: A different tip is returned most of the time whenever the command is executed as the drawing of the tip is entirely random.


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=akkfiros&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)


* **Enhancements to existing features**: AddCommand (PR #87)
  * What it does: Functionality of the command is edited to better suit the function and aim of the application.
  * Justification: This enhancement allows users to keep track of the food they have eaten by adding it into NutriGoals for recording.
  

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
      * Added documentation for the `tip` feature (PR #104)
      * Updated documentation for grammar and readability (PR #161, #173 and #176)

    * Developer Guide:
      * Added documentation for the `tip` and `locate gym` features (PR #176)
      * Updated documentation for grammar and readability (PR #171, #173)
      * Added in documentation for the `Appendix: Effort` section (Pr #178)
