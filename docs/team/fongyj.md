### Project: JARVIS

JARVIS is a desktop application that allows a CS1101S TA to manage his/her students, tasks and lessons in an organised manner.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add and delete notes to lesson / student in a lesson
  * What it does: Allows the user to add notes to a `Lesson` or to a specific `Student` in the `Lesson`. The user can also choose to delete the note(s) added.
  * Justification: Adding notes will allow the tutor to note down important issues and ideas, helping the tutor to remember things and plan lessons better. Deleting notes will allow the tutor to delete notes that are wrongly added or no longer relevant.

* **New Feature**: Mark and unmark lesson / student
    * What it does: Allows the user to mark a lesson as done or mark a student as present in a lesson. The tutor can also unmark the lesson or student.
    * Justification: Marking a lesson or student as done or present will allow the tutor to more easily keep track of lessons and student attendance.
