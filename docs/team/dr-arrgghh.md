### Project: StudMap

StudMap is a lightweight desktop application that addresses your needs of managing the student
records across multiple spreadsheets. Using a CLI (Command Line Interface) approach, we mitigate
the need for teaching assistants to navigate through convoluted menus and buttons when keeping
track of the administrative details for the students. It is written in Java with the GUI implemented
using JavaFX. <br>

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed:** [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=dr-arrgghh)
  
* **New Feature**: `filter`
  - What it does: The `filter` feature allow users to filter Studmap by the specified attribute
  with the given keywords
  - Justification: The user (teaching assistants) might want to single out students from a specific
  module or take note of students that have/have not complete their assignments. The users may also be 
  interested in the specific students that are tagged to track their progress. By allowing the users to 
  filter via `tags`, `module` and `assignments`, it will provide a seamless user experience as the user 
  no longer need to manually search the list for the student of their focus.
  - Highlights: In the original addressbook, there were no filter feature. With a large number of students in
  the current Studmap, it can get really troublesome for the users to search through the entire huge list of students
  just to find that particular student. Using the `filter` feature, it provides a more user-friendly system where they
  can quickly search up list of students categorised by the same `tags`, `modules` or `assignments`.


* **Project management**:
  * Review and merge functional PRs or v1.3

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Able to filter students via tags, module<br>
    and modules
  * Added new fields for students for better<br>
    enhanced identification

* **Documentation**:
  * Provided documentation for `filter` feature for both User Guide and Developer Guide with UML diagrams.
