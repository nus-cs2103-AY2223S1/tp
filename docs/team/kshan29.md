### Project: NUScheduler

NUScheduler is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while
still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NUScheduler can get your
contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
