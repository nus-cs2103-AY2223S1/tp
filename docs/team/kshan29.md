### Project: NUScheduler

NUScheduler is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NUScheduler can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete `Profile`s. (Pull Request [#66](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/66))
  * What it does:
    Allow users to delete a profile from NUScheduler by specifying the index of profile to delete from the displayed list.
  * Justification:
    This is needed for users who wish to delete profiles that are no longer relevant so that the displayed profile list is free from clutter.
  * Credits: This feature is adapted from code in [AddressBook Level-3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3).

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view all `Event`s. (Pull Request [#90](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/90))
  * What it does:
    Allow users to view all events in NUScheduler. 
  * Justification:
    This brings convenience to users who wish to have an overview of all events they have added.
  * Credits: This feature is adapted from code in [AddressBook Level-3](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3).

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view all upcoming `Event`s, i.e. events that are starting in the next specified number of days. (Pull Request [#93](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/93))
  * What it does:
    Allows users to view all upcoming events which are events that starts on the next specified number of days.
  * Justification:
    For users with a long list of events, this feature enables them to easily check what events they have in the next few days.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=kshan29&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Updated the handling of `Email` inputs to accept only NUS email domains. (Pull Request [#67](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/67))
  * What it does: Restrict email inputs to emails with valid NUS email domain.
  * Justification: Our application is catered for NUS students hence only profiles with NUS emails are valid.

* **Enhancements to existing features**: Changed the handling of duplicate profiles from comparing `Name` to comparing `Email`, `Phone` and `Telegram` instead. (Pull Request [#75](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/75))
  * What it does: Allow `Profile`s to have the same `Name` but not that same `Email`, `Phone` or `Telegram`.
  * Justification: Different students might have the same `Name` but should not share the same contact information.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Added documentation for `event -v` and `event -u`. (Pull Request [#54](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/54), [#55](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/55))
    * Added use case for deleting a profile. (Pull Request [#59](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/59))
  * Developer Guide:
    * Updated NFR and Glossary to cater to our project. (Pull Request [#56](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/56))
    * Updated architecture diagrams to reflect our project design. (Pull Request [#99](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/99), [#188](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/188))
    * Added implementation details for delete and view upcoming events commands. (Pull Request [#95](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/95), [#188](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-3/tp/pull/188))
