# Rapportbook

Financial advisors (FA) rely on a large client base for their job. Rapportbook helps new FAs be effective in managing and engaging their clients, by solving the folllowing problems:

- Inefficient use of time

- Motivational issues

- Tracking information about clients

- Hard to promote success status online

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter clients based on names and tags. ([#43](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/issues/43), [#52](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/issues/52), [#58](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/issues/58), [#67](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/issues/67), [#95](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/issues/95))

  * What it does: Allows the user to apply filters to the client list to view clients they are interested in. Applied filters can also be removed individually.
  * Justification: This feature improves the usability of the product as it allows the user to find relevant client data more easily. It also improves the feature fit by providing another use for tags, which could only be used previously as a visual indicator.
  * Highlights: As we wanted the filters to interact differently across different filter types (names or tags), coupling would be an inevitable increase in coupling between the logic and the model. Thus, it required in-depth analysis on design to reduce coupling such that it can be easily tested and extended in the future to other types of filters.

* **New Feature**: Added the display of motivational quote on the program's home page.([#78](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/issues/78))
  * What it does: Greets users with a random motivational quote on start-up or when they access the home page.
  * Justification: While this feature does not provide any functional use, it gives our product a unique flair and helps with motivational issues faced by our target users.
  * Highlights: Since the random quote should remain the same until the application is closed, the Singleton pattern was employed to ensure that the same quote instance is returned for every quote request.
