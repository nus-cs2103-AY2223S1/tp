### Project: PleaseHireUs

PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a desktop app for managing internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PHU can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability view more details of selected internship.
    * What it does: allows the user to view contact details and more.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to view detailed information.
