### Project: PleaseHireUs

PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a desktop app for managing internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PHU can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view more details of a selected internship
    * What it does: Allows the user to view contact details and more
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user will want to view detailed information
