## Project: Financial Advisor Planner

 Financial Advisor Planner is a desktop client management application used for financial advisors to manage their clients. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

 Given below are my contributions to the project.

- ### Feature: Added new `Tags`.
  - What it does: Allows Users to add information about their client through easy to view tags. Currently there are 3  Special Tags:
     - Risk Tag to indicate Client's Risk Appetite
     - Plan Tag to indicate Client's current Financial Plan
     - Client Tag to indicate Client's status
  - All Special Tags are colour coded for users to easily interpret the values even without reading the tags fully.
  - Allow users to find and sort based on Special Tags as well
  - Justification: Financial Advisors(FA) require a way to view their clients information easily, pulling out information that can only have fixed values helps to make reading the information easily.
