### Project: InterNUS

**InterNUS** is a convenient and powerful desktop app, created to help **NUS CS students manage their internship applications.**
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
and complemented with a simple yet intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI)
designed to help you keep track of all your applications at a glance.

Below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `add -p command`
  * What it does: 
Allows user to add contact person to InterNUS.  
  * Justification: 
Users will be able to save contact person information to manage them more conveniently.
