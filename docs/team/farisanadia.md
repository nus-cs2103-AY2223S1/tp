### Project: Pupilist

### Overview
Pupilist is an all-in-one desktop application for private users to arrange their students information. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

### Summary of contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to remove specified fields.
  * What it does: allows the user to remove specified fields from lists in students information.
    * Updated `GradeProgressList`, `HomeworkList`, `SessionList`, and `AttendanceList` to include `removeAtIndex` that allows removal of specified index in respective list.
    * Created `RemoveCommand` and `RemoveCommandParser` and the respective tests
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can wish to remove certain information from their students lists to prevent clutter. 
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
