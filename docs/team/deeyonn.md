### Project: InternConnect

InternConnect is a one-stop, convenient, and efficient platform to manage and empower how internship campus recruiters
who prefer CLI to GUI work with their applicantsâ€™ data. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI
created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * Added the ability to checkout.
    (PR
    [#170](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-2/tp/pull/170))
  * What it does: allows the user to switch between different lists of applicants.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may need to manage different list of
    applicants and the app should provide a convenient way to switch between lists.
  * Highlights: This enhancement modifies the method signature of existing commands and commands to be added in the
    future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives and command dependencies. Different methods were
    evaluated based on design fundamentals such as `Abstraction`, `Coupling`, and `Cohesion`.
