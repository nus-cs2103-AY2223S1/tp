## Project: Class-ify

[Class-ify](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp) is a class management application built specially for Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) teachers
to monitor their student's academic progress easily. Teachers can generate exam statistics for each class, and
Class-ify quickly flags out students who require more support for contacting.

It is written in Java and the GUI is build using JavaFX.
