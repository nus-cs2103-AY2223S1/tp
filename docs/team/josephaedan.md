### Project: CLInkedIn

CLInkedIn is a desktop contact management Java application made for Recruiters to manage their contacts list of candidates using a CLI, and has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=josephaedan&breakdown=true)

* **New Features**:
  * **View Feature**:
    * What it does: Allows the user to view the extended details of a contact in the list. Typing `view` into the command box or clicking onto a person's card in the list will execute this command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to view the extended details of a contact in the list.
  * **Note Feature**:
    * What it does: Allows users to add optional notes to a contact, storing additional information/details that would be helpful for tracking candidates.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to add additional information/details to candidates. This is especially useful for recruiters who are managing a large number of candidates, and need additional avenues to differentiate/track candidates.
  * **Count Display Feature**:
    * What it does: Displays the total number of contacts in the list, and how many of them are currently being displayed in the case where the list has been filtered.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it allows the user to know how many contacts they have at a glance. Additionally, it allows them to view how many contacts meet their current filter criteria.
    * Highlights: This feature works in tandem with the `find` feature, allowing the user to view how many contacts meet their current filter criteria.


* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * **Help Feature**: Extended the `Help` command to show a list of all commands and their respective descriptions, or show the description of a specific command when the user inputs the command name after the `help` command.
    * Previously:
      * The help command only displayed a link to the user guide.
    * Now:
      * The help window additionally displays a table of all available user commands and their usages.
      * The help command has been extended to allow users to view the help window for a specific command by typing `help <command>`.
  * **UI Display**: Revamped the User Interface of CLInkedIn to enhance the user experience when using the application.
    * Previously:
      * The UI was not very intuitive, and did not provide much information to the user.
    * Now:
      * The result display has been expanded and shifted to the right, allowing for greater clarity of the command result.
      * The UI now displays the total number of contacts in the list, and how many of them are currently being displayed in the case where the list has been filtered.
    * Justification: This enhancement improves the product significantly because it creates a seamless user experience in navigating the application while reducing clutter of information displayed on the screen.


* **Documentation**:
  * Readme:
    * Added the project description and the user guide and developer guide link.
    * Added explanation of the target user profile and value proposition.
  * User Guide:
    * Expanded documentation for the `help` command.
    * Added documentation for the `addNote` command.
    * Added documentation for the `addTo` command.

    * Added documentation for the `view` command.
    * Added Table of Contents and Quick Start/Useful Notations sections.
