### Project: Plannit

**Plannit** is an **all-in-one application** that streamlines the execution of module
deliverables by **empowering NUS students** with the ability to manage **tasks**, **links** and
**module-mates** (i.e., students in the same module) to increase their productivity.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

#### Navigation ([#64](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/64))
**New Features:** Added `goto` and `home` commands
  * What it does: <br>
    Allow users to navigate to specific modules and home page to have an overview of details stored in Plannit.
  * Justification: <br>
    Our application aims to streamline the execution of module deliverables,
    the `goto` command is implemented to allow users to view precise information
    relevant to a particular module such as the tasks, links and person which
    are tied to that module, which is critical for our value proposition.
  * Highlights <br>
    The navigation function introduces a new concept of home page and module page which is previously not found
    in AB3. Hence, deliberate considerations have to be put into designing the behaviour to maximise user experience. <br>
    Additionally, The implementation of the navigation system involves constant updating of `UniqueModuleList`,
    `UniquePersonList` and `isHome` status. Hence, it is not trivial as stringent checks are required to ensure the
    proper integration between `Logic`, `Model` and `Ui` to ensure what is executed matches what is seen by the user
    and that `isHome` status is set to the correct state as an incorrect state would jeopardize a user's experience.

##### Search ([#81](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-1/tp/pull/81))
**Enhancements to existing features:** `find` and `list` commands <br>
To ensure that the search functionality complements the navigation functionality, much thought 
has been put into its design.
  * Implemented the follow search commands: `find-module`, `find-person`, `list-module` and `list-person`.
  * Modified existing AB3's predicate to allow users to search by module and person name prefixes to better suit our project needs. 
  * Added constraints that users can only use the search commands at the home page for better user experience.

**Documentation:**
* User Guide:
