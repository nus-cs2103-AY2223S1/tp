### Project: HobbyList

HobbyList is an application for tracking various hobby activities, based on [AddressBook - Level 3](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S1/tp). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java and has about 10kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to rename the commands
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to rename any of the command.
  * Justification: Some users might find the default command names to be unintuitive, so they might want to rename them to something that they feel makes more sense. Some users might also find the commands to be too long, and would like to shorten them.

* **New Feature**: Added a field for reviews and a method to edit them.
  * Justification: People might want to write a review for their activities and this allows them to do so.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=zhenglong3&breakdown=true)

    * User Guide:
        * Added documentation for renaming command names.
    * Developer Guide:
