### Project: GREWZ

GREWZ is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the class group field to each student.
  * What it does: allows the user add, edit and remove the class group field for each student.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it is a key feature for TAs as they will need to identify their students based on class making it a piece of information.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in the future. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
  
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit tasks.
  * What it does: allows the user to edit existing tasks.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes while adding a task and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them as well as update them with the latest information.
  * Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
    * What it does: allows the user to access previous commands using the up and down arrow keys.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because for users who are fast-typists, this feature allows them to revisit frequently used commands with a click of a button.
