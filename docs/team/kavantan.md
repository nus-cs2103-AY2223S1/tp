### Project: Gim

Gim is a **desktop app for managing gym exercises, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Gim allows you to keep track your exercises and Personal Records in an efficient way.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=kavantan&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **New Addition**: Exercise Hashmap ([PR #85](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/85))
  * What it does: Stores exercise data in the form of a hashmap, where the key is the exercise name and the value is a list of exercises with that exercise name.
  * Justification: This hashmap is crucial because it creates precedence for the implementation for many of our other features. For instance, we can now easily find all the exercises (for a certain exercise name) and find the exercise instance with the highest weight amongst them.
  * Highlights: The exercise hashmap was very challenging to implement, because a strong understanding of how data is loaded/saved was necessary. Furthermore, upon tracing the code to learn of this system, it took meticulous effort to ensure that the existing commands/features work in conjunction with the exercise hashmap as well (e.g. add, delete, clear etc.). 

* **New Feature**: Personal Record Listing ([PR #114](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/114) and [PR #117](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/117))
  * What it does: Finds the personal record of certain exercises
  * Justification: With this command, users will be able to keep track of their progression of certain exercises in the gym.
  * Highlights: This command was tricky to implement because of two reasons. Firstly, this command has to 'perform calculations' based on specific exercises from the exercise tracker, hence it was difficult tricky to understand and implement the retrieval of these specific exercises. Secondly, because of the nature of how the command is parsed, there were many considerations to be made. E.g. If the name input was not in the exercise tracker, if there were multiple similar entries etc.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Refactor AB3-specific references in original AB3 to relatable references for Gim ([PR #49](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/49) and [PR #65](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/65))
    * What I did: Refactored 'seedu.address' package to 'gim', instances of 'person' to 'exercise' and 'address book' references to 'exercise tracker'
    * Justification: In Gim, we are storing exercises instead of persons. Hence, to eliminate future confusion using the OOP paradigm, it was best that we refactored the no-longer-relevant references from the original AB3 to more relevant references that we would be use in Gim. 
  * Allow addition of duplicate exercises ([PR #69](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/69))
    * What I did: Allow users to add 'duplicate' exercises into the system.
    * Justification: Unlike in the original address book (where users cannot add duplicate names), users should be able to add the same exercise into the system to signify that they performed that exercise on multiple occasions.
  * Implement mandatory use of confirm flag for 'clear' function ([PR #138](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/138))
    * What I did: Mandate that a user must type in 'confirm' before they can successfully clear their exercise tracker.
    * Justification: For new users that may be unfamiliar with the 'clear' command, they might not understand what it does and may accidentally clear their exercise tracker unknowingly. The mandatory 'confirm' serves as a safety warning, aiming to prevent such accidental deletions of the exercise tracker.

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Notes about command format ([PR #124](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/124))
    * Personal Record ([PR #124](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/124))
    * Useful notations ([PR #195](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/195))
