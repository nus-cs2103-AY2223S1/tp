## Project: Class-ify

Class-ify is a class management application built specially for Singapore Ministry of Education (MOE) teachers
to monitor their student's academic progress easily. Teachers can generate exam statistics for each class, and
Class-ify quickly flags out students who require more support for contacting.

It is written in Java and the GUI is build using JavaFX.
