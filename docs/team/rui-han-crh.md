### Project: SectresBook

SectresBook helps secretaries to maintain all the information of the members of their club by collating a list of identifiable information, past records and future tasks. <br>Given below are my contributions to the project.

**Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=w12&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=rui-han-crh&tabRepo=AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

**New Features Implemented**

1. **_Loan Property of a Person_** ([#50](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/pull/50))
  * **What it does**: Implements the ability to track monetary amounts that are represented as loaned amounts. The loan amounts must be between -1 trillion to 1 trillion inclusive.
  * **Justification**: A treasurer requires the need to keep track of monetary transactions. A loan is a data type created to serve this purpose.
  
2. **_User Interface Design_** ([#75](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/pull/75))
   * **What it does**: Remodel and redesigned the user interface as shown in the landing page. Various small icons, images, alignment details and transitions are also applied for visual enhancement.
   * **Justification**: The previous UI design did not look appealing, so a more visually appealing design was created. This will help the product's publicity and attractiveness to clients.
   * **Highlights**: Event based triggers (space to start typing, esc to exit typing), transition effects and embellishments.

3. **_Inspect command_** ([#75](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/pull/75))
   * **What it does**: Inspects a person in the person's list. Inspection is a UI-centric command that updates UI values. It does not mutate any data in the model. This is also equivalent to just click on the person card.
   * **Justification**: The UI requires more flexibility when coupled with the CLI, there shouldn't be things that the GUI can do that the CLI cannot, so the `inspect` command was created.

4. **_Show and Hide Notes Panel Command_** ([#75](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/pull/75))
   * **What it does**: Shows/hides the notes panel by applying a translational transition with a fade transition to the StackPane containing the notes panel with anchor points on an AnchorPane. 
   * **Justification**: It is difficult to view more than 6 people in the list at the same time especially if working on a monitor with a smaller resolution. By hiding the notes panel, more screen real estate can be given to the person list and inspect panel.

5. **_Edit By Name_** ([#52](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/pull/52))
   * **What it does**: Adding onto the ability to edit by index, I implemented an ability to edit by any keyword of the person's name. This makes it more convenient to specify edit operations without checking for name
   * **Justification**: It is easier to recall a person's name than to read the index from the list.

**Project management**:

* Called meetings to discuss plans.
* Created milestones and description of milestones and provided feedback on Github PRs and organised issues with tags.

**Contributions to team-based tasks**:

* Setting up the GitHub team org/repo
* Changed the product icon to the current version (ledger with pen) using GIMP ([#102](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/pull/102))
* Released version v1.3.1 for PE-D and fixed 16 bugs after PE-D ([#179](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-2/tp/pull/179))

**Review/mentoring contributions**:

* Reviewed contributions by other group members, sometimes suggesting other alternatives for better maintainability.
* Gave comments on suggestions for bug fixes in the issues tab and published issues based on more bugs found in the issues sections.

**Contributions beyond the project team**:

* Frequently posted in the forums to help other on iP related issues, such as setting the background, smoke testing and basic feature development.
* During the PE-D, authored issues based on the structure of `Description`, `Steps to reproduce` and `Suggestion`, making the issues clear and reproducible

**Contributions to the UG/DG**:
