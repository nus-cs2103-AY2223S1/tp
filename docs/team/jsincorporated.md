### Project: uNivUSal

uNivUSal is a desktop application used to link CS2103T users to all the modes of communication of other users to make their lives easier. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to group contacts.
  * What it does: Allows the user to categorize their contacts into groups.
  * Commands: `addtogroup` `ungroup` `group`
  * Justification: This feature significantly improves the usability of the product as it allows users to more effectively manage their contacts.
  * Highlights: This enhancement also adds a popup window for each group, along with an `Email All` button which should be useful for TAs and Professors.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to email all the contacts in a group.
  * What it does: Allows the user to contact all members of a group by email with a single command.
  * Justification: As our application is targeted towards TAs and Professors, this feature significantly enhances the application as they often have to message all students in a tutorial/module.
  * Highlights: This command works with any web browsers and email clients, whichever is set as the default on the user's computer.
