### Project: JeeqTracker

JeeqTracker is a desktop application created for **home-based business owners / resellers** that helps them manage the clients
that they interact with by keeping track of their **`BUY / SELL`** transactions, and **`REMARKS`** of clients.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to `filter` all the transactions by all the clients
  * What it does: allows the user to view all `buy` or `sell` transactions made by all the clients.
  * Justification: This feature is useful for the user to look at the `buy` or `sell` transactions made by all the clients at one glance.


* **New Feature**: Added the `create` function which was previously used to create a point of contact. The command is now refactored to create a new remark for the specified client.
  * What it does: allows the user to create a new remark that is linked to the specified client
  * Justification: This feature is helpful in allowing users to add remark for a client.


* **New Feature**: Added ability to open the `user_guide` url
    * What it does: allows the user to copy the url of the user guide
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to access the user guide to learn how to use the application effectively.
    

* **New Model**: Created `Transaction Model` which includes `Transaction`, `TransactionLog`, `Goods`, `Price`, `Quantity`, `BuyTransaction` and `SellTransaction`
  * What it does: allow the application to use the model to store the transactions by the clients.
  * Justification: This model is necessary for the creation of the transaction commands.
