### Project: SoConnect

SoConnect is a desktop app for NUS SoC students to manage their contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
