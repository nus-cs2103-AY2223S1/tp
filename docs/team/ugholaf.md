### Project: SoConnect

SoConnect is a **desktop app for managing contacts and tasks**. It aims to help NUS SoC students stay better connected to their school life, in terms of social connections and school tasks. SoConnect is also **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 42 kLoC.


## Contribution

### New Feature: Autocomplete on Search Functionality

**What it does**: Provides a list of autocompleted search entries based on what the user has typed in the command box, this allows the user to choose the autocompleted entries and search without having to type the full command.

**Justification**: This feature improves the user productivity significantly because the user will not need to type the full command upon searching, this will also reduce the mistakes that the user might make when entering a long search command.

**Highlight**: This enhancement affects the user interface. It required an in-depth analysis on how the autocomplete entries are generated and how the command box should behave when the user clicks it or enters certain keys. The implementation was challenging as it requires some knowledge on JavaFX and how autocomplete works.
