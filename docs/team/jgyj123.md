### Project: Watson

Project: Watson, The Teacher's Companion
Watson is a desktop database application used to reduce the administrative workload of teachers greatly. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**:
  * `Grading`: Added the ability for users to enter the grades of students
    * What it does: Opens a separate GUI window for teachers to key in the grades of their students
    * Since our application is aimed at reducing the workload of teachers for administrative tasks, adding a new grading GUI window will significantly speed up the process of adding grades to students
  
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jgyj123&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=jgyj123&tabRepo=AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
