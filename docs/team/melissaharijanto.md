## Project: TrackO

**TrackO** is a desktop application that helps small home-based business owners manage their orders and inventory
efficiently in the form of an integrated solution built using Java with around 15 kLOC. The user interacts with the
application via a CLI, and the application responds with its GUI, created with JavaFX.

    [#192](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/192)
    - What was done: Create a [design draft](https://www.figma.com/file/h6iechtBx1GaeJ6kKeqadb/CS2103T-UI-Design?node-id=0%3A1),
    then implement it into the application with JavaFX. 

  - **More Features/Enhancements Added**:
    - **Implement the base model for `java.tracko.model.item`** — [#58](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/58)
      - What was done: Added the base code for `Item` (`ItemName`, `InventoryList`, `Item`, `Description`, `Quantity`
      classes) for the members to build on, utilizing object-oriented programming.

    - **Implement the following commands: `edito`, `listi`, `findi`** — [#68](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/68), [#111](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/111)
        - `edito`: Edits orders.
        - `listi`: Lists all the existing inventory items.
        - `findi`: Finds existing inventory items that match certain keyword(s) inputted by the user.

    - **Implement order completion status** — [#104](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/104)
      - What it does: Orders now have a completion status: `paid` or `delivered`.

    - **Implement feature to calculate the price of an order's list of ordered items** — [#131](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/131)
        - What it does: Implement methods to calculate the price of the customer's ordered items.
  
    - **Write test cases** — [#100](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/100),
      [#122](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/122)
      - What was done: Implemented JUnit test cases for the following: `EditOrderDescriptorTest`, 
      `EditOrderCommandTest`, `EditOrderDescriptorBuilder`, `DeleteOrderCommandParserTest`, `DeleteOrderCommandTest`,
      `DeleteItemCommandTest`, `DeleteItemCommandParserTest`, `QuantityTest`, `DescriptionTest`, `ItemNameTest`
      - Justification: Testing will reduce the chances of bugs occurring in the program.
