### Project: GREWZ

GREWZ is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented ***add/remove task*** feature of GREWZ
    * What it does: allows the user to add new tasks as well as remove existing tasks
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because teaching assistants need to micromanage multiple things at the same time and the app should provide a convenient way for them to keep track of the things that need to be done.
    * Highlights: It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation is such that different types of specialized tasks could be extended from it.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=thamruicong&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.4` (3 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Modified `clear` feature to clear tasks as well (Pull request [\#195](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-4/tp/pull/195))
