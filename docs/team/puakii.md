### Project: FindMyIntern

**Overview**: FindMyIntern is a desktop application that helps students keep track of internship applications. It allows students to consolidate all these applications into a single place, manage these applications, and visualise their application statuses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. FindMyIntern is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=puakii&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Added new feature `find`
    * What it does: Find specific internship applications based on company and tags
    * Justification: User would want to find certain internship applications from the large number of applications he/she have
  * Implemented `ApplicationStatus`
    * What it does: Represents the status of an internship application
    * Justification: Key field of an internship application. As such, this is crucial for commands such as `mark` to be possible
  * Updated `Tag`
    * Changes: Allow spacing into tag field
    * Justification: User might want to key in more than 1 word into tag
  * Refactored `Person` to `Internship`
    * Changes: Change all instances of `Person` to `Internship` in the code base
    * Justification: Essential for the team to develop FindMyIntern as a brownfield project
