### Project: YellowBook

YellowBook is for university students who are involved in many projects and have to organize their project contacts and tasks. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark/unmark tasks.
    * What it does: allows the user to indicate a task as complete using the mark task command or incomplete using the
    unmark task command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it enables the user to keep track of their
    task completion status, which helps them with better task management through giving them insights on overall work
    progress.


* **New Feature**: Added command to print a string of emails belonging to contacts under a specific label.
    * What it does: allows the user to copy the string of emails printed and paste it wherever necessary (e.g. sharing
    project documents, emailing the entire group).
    * Justification: This feature improves the product by making it more convenient for users to access multiple group
    members' emails at the same time for project management tasks.
