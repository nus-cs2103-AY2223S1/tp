### Project: Teaching Assistant Assistant

Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs). It keeps track of TAsâ€™ students,
tutorial groups, and tasks.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Enhancement Added**:
    * **New Feature**: Added the grade functionality and commands
        * What it does: allows the user to view and edit grades 
        * Every student-task pair is associated with a grade. Therefore, it was natural to use to a map to implement 
the grades feature. However, maps were not used in the AB3 codebase so it was challenging to incorporate a map into
TAA. Since the grade interacts with both the `Student` and `Task` classes, there were some unexpected behaviours which
had to be dealt with, particularly when tasks and students were edited (as these operations would result in the creation
of new `Student` and `Task` objects).

* **Team-tasks**: 
    * Refactored variables, class names, etc. in the AB3 codebase to make semantic sense for TAA [#50](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/50)
    * Set up [Kanban board](https://postimg.cc/BPbCmLT0/cb052c47) on Github Projects to track issues better
    * Set up Milestone v1.1 and assigned issues. Also set up Milestone v1.4
    * Incorporated [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) into project to create mock classes faster in unit tests [#69](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/pull/69/)
