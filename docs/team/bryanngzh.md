### Project: ProfNUS

ProfNUS is a **desktop application which helps SOC Professors who have many modules with many students/TAs to manage.** It is optimized for users who prefer CLI over GUI so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
    * Implemented models related to `Module` class of ProfNUS. 
      * The `Module` class to hold data regarding the module. 
      * The `ModuleCode` class to hold data regarding the module's code for a module.
      * The `ModuleDescription` class to hold data regarding the module's description for a module.
      * The `ModuleName` class to hold data regarding the module's name for a module.
      * The `UniqueModuleList` class to hold all Module data in ProfNUS. 
    * Implemented the `mlist` command to allow users to view the list of modules in ProfNUS.
    * Implemented the `mview` command to allow users to view information regarding a module in ProfNUS.
    * Implemented the foundation for the mlist page and mview page in the GUI to display module information.
