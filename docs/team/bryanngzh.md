### Project: ProfNUS

ProfNUS is a **desktop application which helps SOC Professors who have many modules with many students/TAs to manage.** It is optimized for users who prefer CLI over GUI so that frequent tasks can be done faster by typing in commands.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

    * Implemented models related to `Module` class of ProfNUS. [#56](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-2/tp/pull/56)
      * The `Module` class to hold data regarding the module. 
      * The `ModuleCode` class to hold data regarding the module's code for a module.
