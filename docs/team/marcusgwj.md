### Project: FindMyIntern

**Overview**: FindMyIntern is a desktop application that helps students keep track of internship applications. 
It allows students to consolidate all these applications into a single place, manage these applications, and visualise 
their application statuses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
FindMyIntern is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=marcusgwj&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
    * Added new feature `sort`
        * What it does: Allows the user to sort internship applications by applied date or interview date
        * Justifications: The user will want to be able to sort by date so he/she can view internship applications in 
          a chronological order, and prioritise different applications.

        * What it does: Represents the criteria used to sort internship applications
        * Justification: Crucial for`sort` command to be possible
    * Refactoring AB3
        * Updated all instances of AddressBook to FindMyIntern
