### Project: FindMyIntern

**Overview**: FindMyIntern is a desktop application that helps students keep track of internship applications. 
It allows students to consolidate all these applications into a single place, manage these applications, and visualise 
their application statuses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. 
FindMyIntern is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

        * What it does: Allows the user to sort internship applications by applied date or interview date

          a chronological order, and prioritise different applications.
