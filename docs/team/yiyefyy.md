### Project: NotionUS

NotionUS is a lightweight but powerful application that can help you to manage your assignments and tasks. It sports a sleek and minimalist design which allows you to clearly see your outstanding tasks at a glance.

    * Highlights: This feature creates an archived list which originally has the list feature, but...
