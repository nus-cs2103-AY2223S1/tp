## Project: WorkBook

### Overview

WorkBook (WB) is a desktop app for CS/tech students who are applying for internships to manage their internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, WB can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
