### Project: MODPRO

MODPRO is a desktop application which helps NUS students in tracking the progress of their modules. It is highly optimised for students who prefer Command Line Interface (CLI) by allowing those who type fast to key in commands to track their modules. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
