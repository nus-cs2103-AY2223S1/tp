### Project: JerylFypManager

JerylFypManager is a desktop application catered to professors to manage and track the progress for students’ final year
project (FYP), as well as serving as a platform for professors to provide feedback on their students’ progress. The user
interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC. This
project is based on AddressBook - Level 3.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Allows for users to edit student's information and FYP projects.

  * What it does: Professors can edit student's information (eg: change in email address, FYP project) easily.

  * Justifications: Students may need to change their email address, or might even change their FYP project all together.

  * Highlights: Allows for quick changing of student parameters, instead of deleting entry and retyping it


* **New Feature**: Allows for users to delete student's information and FYP projects.

  * What it does: Professors can delete student's information once student drops an FYP project.

  * Justifications: Having lots of student information in the app may be quite cluttering. Hence, deleting students who
  have dropped the FYP would keep only relevant information, making things neat and easy to read.

  * Highlights: Allows easy removal of student's information from the app.

  * Credits: @RussellDash for all the help
