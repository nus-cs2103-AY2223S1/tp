### Project: EZLead

EZLead is a **desktop app for tech leads to manage teams optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)**.
As a tech lead, you will be able to easily keep track of all the teams under you as well as each team's current and
future tasks. With our app, teams management would be easier than ever.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to mark/unmark task as done.
    * What it does: allows the users to mark which all tasks has been done and not done.
    * Justification: This feature allows user to see how many of their tasks has been done and how many are yet to be done.
    * Highlights: This enhancement helps in adding new features when a task is created. A task is marked as not done when a task is created.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit a task.
    * What it does: allows user to edit the task description and deadline of the already existing task.
    * Justification: This feature allows user to add deadline of a task in future and also to edit the task name.
    * Highlights: This enhancement provided flexibility in editing the task, by making it optional to provide either task description or deadline.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete a task.
  * What it does: allows user to delete the task in the future.
  * Justification: This feature allows user to remove the task when the task is done or is no more required.
