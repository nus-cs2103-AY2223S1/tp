### Project: JeeqTracker

JeeqTracker is a desktop application created for **home-based business owners / resellers** that helps them manage the clients
that they interact with by keeping track of their **`BUY / SELL`** transactions, and **`REMARKS`** of clients.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `buy` and `sell` commands
  * What it does: allows the user to create `buy` and `sell` commands and link them to the specific client to keep track of their transactions
    with them.
  * Justification: This feature is essential for users to input transactions so that our application can keep track of them.


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=notle1706&tabRepo=AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
