### Project: LongTimeNoSee(LTNS)

Long Time No See (LTNS) is a desktop task tracking app made for student financial advisors to manage their contact base and stay connected with their clients. Made simpler with an intuitive and minimalistic graphical user interface (GUI) and customised functionalities to pinpoint your needs, LTNS will enable you to stay close to your dearest clients!

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the main representation of our users' available policies, i.e: The `policy` class.
  * Justification: This feature allows us to store policies sold by the user.
  * Highlights:  It stores information about a given policy, like policy duration, premium and coverage type.
  * Credits: *{mention here if you reused any code/ideas from elsewhere or if a third-party library is heavily used in the feature so that a reader can make a more accurate judgement of how much effort went into the feature}*
