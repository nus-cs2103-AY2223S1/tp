## Project: SoCompiler

### Overview

SoCompiler is the sole app that university students will need to streamline their everyday routines.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **`Module` Class**:
  * Added the `Module` Class and its associated classes.(Pull request [#45](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/45))
  * The associated classes include:
    * `LectureDetails`
    * `ModuleCode`
    * `TutorialDetails`
    * `ZoomLink`

  * Added the `Telegram` Class that is associated with a `Person` (Pull request [#115](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/115))

* **Replaced `Address` with `ModuleCode` in `Person`**:
  * Redid the tests for the affected classes that used `Address` in the `Person` Class. (Pull request [#113](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/113))
