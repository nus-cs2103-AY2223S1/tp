### Project: FinBook

FinBook is a desktop app for Financial Assistant (FA) to manage their client details and ensure that your data is
secured. With FinBook, you can set a unique password, manage and view client's details, meetings and portfolio as well
as many other features to make your daily workflow much more efficient!

### Overview

FinBook is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), which means most of our commands are done by typing.

### Summary of Contributions

* **Code
  contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=alexandermula&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
    * New feature: Sort command
        * What it does: allows the user to sort clients by a parameter by using the `sort PARAMETER` command
        * Sort parameters include: Client name, client income, meeting date and time
        * Justification: Since Financial Advisors spend the majority of their time doing administrative work, this 
          feature would greatly reduce the time spent manually arranging clients by certain parameters. Furthermore, 
          it would be easier to plan meetings with clients using the sort command.
    * New feature: Hide/Show sensitive data mode 
      * What it does: allows the user to hide or show sensitive client data by toggling the `hide` button
      * Justification: Since Financial Advisors likely show their clients their portfolios during meetings, it is
        important to ensure other client data in FinBook is hidden.
    * Existing feature: Add Command
        * Enhanced `add` command to include the ability to add meeting dates with optional meeting times

        * Enhanced `edit` command to include the ability to edit meeting dates with optional meeting times
