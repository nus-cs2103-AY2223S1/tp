### Project: TaskBook

TaskBook is a desktop address book and task assignment application used for NUS students to efficiently manage their 
contacts and tasks.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Tagging and untagging of tasks ([#175](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/175))
  * What it does: Allows the user to tag their tasks in the TaskBook for their convenience.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product by allowing users to gather information about a task in their list at a quick glance.
  * Credits: Some implementation ideas were taken from AB3's contact tag feature.

* **New Feature**: Adding tasks ([#107](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/107))
  * What it does: Allows users to add a task to their task list.
  * Justification: This feature is necessary as a core function of a task manager application.

* **New Feature**: Deleting tasks ([#113](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/113))
  * What it does: Allows users to delete a task from their task list.
  * Justification: This feature is necessary as a core function of a task manager application.
  
* **New Feature**: Task sub-classes: `Todo`, `Deadline`, `Event` ([#135](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/135))
  * What it does: Models and classifies a task into its core types.
  * Justification: This feature models tasks in the real world and categorises them into their different types.
  * Highlights: The feature follows OOP principles closely, namely inheritance and polymorphism as it inherits from the `Task` super class.
  * Credits: Some of the implementation is inspired by the individual project.
  
* **New Feature**: `task list` command ([#179](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/pull/179))
  * What it does: Allows the user view all of their tasks without any filters.
