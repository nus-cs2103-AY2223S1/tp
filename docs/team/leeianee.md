### Project: FindMyIntern

**Overview**: FindMyIntern is a desktop application that helps students keep track of internship applications. It allows students to consolidate all these applications into a single place, manage these applications, and visualise their application statuses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. FindMyIntern is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
