### Project: Watson, The Teacher's Companion

Watson is a desktop database application used to reduce the administrative workload of teachers greatly. The user
interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
    * `Subject`: Added a Subject class.
        * What it does: allows subjects to be tagged to SubjectHandler which is tagged to Student.
        * Justification: Since our application is targeted at reducing the administrative workload of teachers, it is
          essential for the application to be able to keep track of the Subjects taken by each student.
    * `Grades`: Added a Grades class.
        * What it does: allows Grades to be tagged to Subject.
        * Justification: Since our application is targeted at reducing the administrative workload of teachers, it is
          essential for the application to be able to keep track of the Grades for each Subject taken by each student.
