### Project: RC4HDB

RC4HDB is a desktop application which streamlines the daily workflow of RC4 housing management staff, by providing specialised features which solve their resident & venue management needs.

Given below is a summary of my notable contributions to the project.

### **Code contributed**:

#### New features

* Added the file management features, including CSV file importing.
* Added some venue commands, including `UnbookCommand`, `VenueAddCommand`, `VenueDeleteCommand` and `VenueViewCommand`.
* Added `VenueTabView`, `VenueListView` and `VenueListCard` components.

#### Code quality improvements:
* Improved code quality of most `Ui` components.
* Created abstractions such as `StringField`, `FileCommand`, `VenueCommand` to consolidate common logic between subclasses.

#### Infrastructure changes:
* Modified the existing command pattern implementation to be able to execute on other components, such as the `Storage` component.
* Made code base wide changes to support venue management features.
* Modified the `Storage` component to support the new file management features.

#### Test contributions:
* Added tests code base wide, totalling to more than 4000 lines of test code.
* Updated existing unit tests with stubs to reduce dependencies. e.g. `ImportCommandTest`, `LogicManagerTest`.
