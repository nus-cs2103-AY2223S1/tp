### Project: myStudent

myStudent is **an easy-to-use, portable and aesthetically-pleasing desktop application for tuition centre admins
for managing the students, tutors and tuition classes of a tuition center**.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to assign tuition class to student and tutors. (Pull request [#66](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/pull/66))
    * What it does: allow user to assign tuition class to student and tutors.
    * Justification: This feature allows user to be able to assign tuition class to student if the student is enrolled to the class
  and assign tuition class to tutor if the tutor is currently teaching the class. This allows the users to keep track of tuition classes 
  the student and tutor are currently enrolled or teaching respectively.
    * Highlights: Requires to modify the `Student` and `Tutor` class in model component and in-depth consideration of design to ensure
  that the `Student` and `Tutor` data can be saved in Json format and read back.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to unassign tuition classes from student and tutors. [#66](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-4/tp/pull/66))
    * What it does: allow user to unassign tuition class from student and tutors.
        * Justification: This feature allows user to be able to unassign tuition class from student if the student is no longer enrolled to the tuition class
          and unassign tuition class from tutor if the tutor is no longer teaching the class. This allows the users to keep track of tuition classes
          the student and tutor are currently enrolled or teaching respectively.
        * Highlights: Requires to modify the `Student` and `Tutor` class in model component and in-depth consideration of design to ensure
          that the `Student` and `Tutor` data can be saved in Json format and read back.
