# Project: ConnectNUS

## Overview
ConnectNUS is a desktop address book application used for NUS CS students to keep track of their own modules, and their friend's modules and contacts as well. This is to facilitate NUS CS students to keep track of their friends to work with so that they can easily find friends to collaborate with.

## Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: User profile
  * What it does: Allows for users to save their own details, modules and lessons.
  * Justification: This is for easy reference and to allow users to compare their modules and timetables with their friend's so that they can collaborate better with them on projects or modules.
  * Highlights: Users are able to add, edit and delete their user profiles.


* **New Feature**: Module commands
  * What it does: Allows for users to directly add or delete modules from their own profiles or their contact's profiles.
  * Justification: This is to allow for more seamless editing of module lists with a single command.


* **New Feature**: Modules left
  * What it does: Allows for users to check which modules they have yet to take to fulfill core or focus area requirements.
  * Justification: This helps users to keep track of their study plan better.
  * Highlights: Users are able to search for each focus area's requirements easily from an indexed list.


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=shamooose&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)


* **Enhancements to existing features**: Add Github to contacts
  * What it does: Add Github username field to contacts and a Copy Github URL button that copies the Github URL of the contact or user into your clipboard.
  * Justification: The Github field and button makes collaboration with friends easier as you are easily able to access their Github profiles, so you can view their past projects and contributions more easily.
