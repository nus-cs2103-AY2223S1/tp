### Project: FinBook

FinBook is a desktop app for Financial Assistant (FA) to manage their client details and ensure that your data is
secured. With FinBook, you can set a unique password, manage and view client's details, meetings and portfolio as well
as many other features to make your daily workflow much more efficient!

### Overview

FinBook is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), which means most of our commands are done by typing.

### Summary of Contributions

* **Code
  contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=leecaregene&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
    * **New feature**: Import command
        * What it does: Allows the user to import data from a JSON or CSV file.
        * Justification: Lets the user add multiple clients at once from an external source, saving them time as they do not have to reinsert the clients one by one. It also lets the user move their data between devices easily.
        * Highlights: Works seamlessly in conjunction with the export command. The user can import data that has been exported using the export command.
        * Credits: Uses [OpenCSV](https://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) for reading from CSV files.
    * **New feature**: Export command
        * What it does: Allows the user to export data to a CSV file.
        * Justification: Lets the user edit their data using other applications. This is particularly useful when there are a lot of (>100) clients stored in FinBook, as is easier to edit this data using spreadsheet software like Excel.
        * Highlights: Works seamlessly in conjunction with the import command. The user can export data, optionally edit the data, and reimport it using the import command.
        * Credits: Uses [OpenCSV](https://opencsv.sourceforge.net/) for writing to CSV files.
    * **New feature**: Lock command
        * What it does: Allows the user to lock FinBook. A password dialog box asking for the user's password is displayed, and the user can resume using FinBook after entering the correct password.
        * Justification: Prevents unauthorised parties from using FinBook without permission from the user, enhancing the privacy of the user's data.
        * Highlights:
            * Works seamlessly in conjunction with the password command. The user can lock FinBook after setting a password using the password command.
            * If a password is set, the password dialog box is displayed on startup of FinBook.
        * Credits: Uses [Password4j](https://password4j.com/) for password verification.
    * **New feature**: Password command
        * What it does: Allows the user to set or update their FinBook password. The user will receive feedback on their chosen password.
        * Justification: Lets the user set a password for FinBook, enhancing the privacy of the user's data. It also discourages the user from choosing a weak password.
        * Highlights:
            * Works seamlessly in conjunction with the lock command. The user can set a password before locking FinBook using the lock command.
            * The estimated strength of the password is displayed. If it is weak, warnings and suggestions on how to improve the password are provided to the user.
        * Credits: Uses [Password4j](https://password4j.com/) for password hashing, and [zxcvbn4j](https://github.com/nulab/zxcvbn4j) for password strength estimation.

### Contributions to the User Guide (Extracts)

### 4.2.1. Locking the application : `lock`

Locks the application.

Format: `lock`

The following dialog box will be displayed:

![Password dialog box](../images/LockWindow.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**

* If a password has not been set, leave the password field empty to unlock the application.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
The lock feature only serves to prevent unauthorized usage of FinBook. Anyone with access to your PC is still able to view and edit the `JSON` files containing your data.
</div>

### 4.3.3. Importing data : `import`

Imports data from a `JSON` or `CSV` file.

* `JSON` files must be saved by the latest version of FinBook
* `CSV` files must be formatted correctly as follows:
    * The first line of the file must contain these headers in any order:
        * `name`
        * `phone`
        * `email`
        * `address`
        * `income`
        * `meeting date`
        * `tags`
        * `risk`
        * `plans`
        * The data in each corresponding column must be valid
            * `tags` must be separated by commas `,` without spaces (e.g. `VIPPClient,YuFamily`)
            * `plans` must be separated by commas `,` without spaces (
              e.g. `prudential income,NTUC income,prudential health`)

Format: `import PATH`

* Imports data from the file at the specified `PATH`
* `PATH` can be a relative or full path
* `PATH` must end in `.json` or `.csv`

Examples:

* `import ./data.json` imports data from the file `data.json` which is located in the same directory as the FinBook
  executable
* `import ../data.csv` imports data from the file `data.csv` which is located one level outside the directory of the
  FinBook executable
