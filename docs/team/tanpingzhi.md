### Project: NutriGoals

NutriGoals is a desktop app that tracks a user’s diet and calorie consumption. Studies have shown the benefits of
keeping track of your daily food consumption – the more consistent you are, the more likely you are to achieve the
various fitness goals that you have set for yourself! However, without the right tools, tracking what you have consumed
can be tedious and at times disorganised. With NutriGoals, you can keep track of your consumption quickly and easily,
without worrying about organising your data.
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: TargetCommand (PR [#35](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/35))
    * What it does: It allows the user to set a daily calorie goal.
    * Justification: The project aims to help users to keep track of their calorie intake. Setting a target daily
      calorie allows a user to keep track of the amount of calories left to consume within their target.

* **New Feature**: LocateGymCommand (PR [#66](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/66))
    * What it does: Returns a list of gyms in NUS sorted by distance to the user
    * Justification: The project aims to help users start a healthy lifestyle. But after having online lessons for
      several years, some students are not familiar with NUS' facilities. This command helps the users to find gyms with
      ease.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Styled UI of app to match the theme and increase appeal
      (PR [#95](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/95))
        * What it does:
            1. Change the colors of the food card in the list of food.
            2. Add spacing in between the food card.
            3. Round the edges of the food card.
