# Rapportbook

Financial advisors (FA) rely on a large client base for their job. Rapportbook helps new FAs be effective in managing and engaging their clients, by solving the following problems:
- Inefficient use of time
- Motivational issues
- Tracking information about clients
- Hard to promote success status online

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=craeyeons&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
- **New Features**: Added the "Remark" field.
  - What it does: Allows the user to add a remark on all clients.
  - Justification: We want to allow users to keep track of delicate details of their clients.
  - Highlights: Integration with other commands (add and edit).
- **Enhancement**: Changed parameter input syntax from "prefix/input" to "prefix=input".
  - What it does: Changes the input format.
  - Justification: We believe that "=" makes more sense than "/" as we are defining the prefix **to be equal to** what was given.
- **Tests**: Written test cases for the Reminder feature.
  - The test cases increased code coverage by 7.61%. (Percentage is taken from codecov)
- **Tests**: Written test cases for the Messages feature.
  - The test cases increased code coverage by 1.5%. (Percentage is taken from codecov)
- **Contributions to team-based tasks**
  - Updated the README page of the project.
  - v1.2 postmortem.
  - v1.3 demo.
- **Review/mentoring contributions**:
  - Reviewed team member's PRs and occasionally provided suggestions to improve.
