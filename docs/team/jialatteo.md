## Project: Financial Advisor Planner

Financial Advisor Planner is a desktop client management application used for financial advisors to manage their clients. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- ### Code contributed: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jialatteo&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=jialatteo&tabRepo=AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-2%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
- ### Enhancement: Added `Parameter hints`
- What it does: After typing a command word, the result display will automatically show the correct command format
- Justification: New users might not remember all the parameters, prefixes and the correct command format. Hence, the parameter hints can guide them to fill up the command correctly without constantly referring to the user guide.

- ### Feature: Implemented `ea`
- What it does: Allows the user to edit an appointment's location and datetime field
- Justification: FAs might want to modify the appointment details, hence editing an appointment is necessary.
- ### Feature: Implemented `da`
- What it does: Allows the user to delete an appointment
- Justification: FAs might want to delete the appointment, hence deleting an appointment is necessary.
- ### Feature: Implemented `Command History`
- What it does: Allows the user to use up and down arrow keys to navigate through the command history
- Justification: Users might want to re-enter a command but with minor modifications. Instead of typing out the whole command again, users can navigate to their previously entered commands to make changes as they see fit before pressing enter
