### Project: CLInkedIn

CLInkedIn is a desktop address book application made for Recruiting and Hiring Managers. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add/Delete different kinds of Tags
  * What it does: 
    * Allows the user to add and delete different kinds of tags (e.g. Skills TagType tag, Job Type TagType tag, Degree TagType tag, etc.) to a candidate. 
    * For example, `addTag 2 st/java dt/Bachelors` adds a Skill TagType tag `java` and Degree TagType tag `Bachelors` to the second candidate in the displayed list of candidates.
  * Implementation specifications:
    * In order to keep a track of the different kinds of tags for each candidate, the `UniqueTagTypeMap` class was created and a field `tagTypeMap` of reference type `UniqueTagTypeMap` was added to `Person`. Moreover, the `UniqueTagList` class was created in order to keep track of all the tags of a particular `TagType` of a candidate. The `UniqueTagTypeMap` internally uses an `ObservableMap`, backed by a `HashMap`, that maps each `TagType` of the candidate to a `UniqueTagList` of tags.

* **New Feature**: Export/Import
  * What it does:
    * Allows the user to export the displayed list of candidates to the specified location as a JSON/CSV file and import the data of candidates from the specified JSON/CSV file.
    * For example, `export path//Desktop/sample/data.csv` exports the displayed list of candidates to `data.csv` in the `sample` directory of the `Desktop` and `import path//Desktop/sample/data.csv` imports the list of candidates from `data.csv` in the `sample` directory of the `Desktop` to the addressbook.
  * Implementation specifications:
    * In order to read and write to CSV files, the **OpenCSV** parser library was used.
    * UI components `ExportWindow` and `ImportWindow` were created in order to make the Export and Import process more convenient for the user.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Extended the `add` command to support the addition of different kinds of tags while adding a candidate.
  * Extended the `edit` command to support the modification of the existing tags belonging to a candidate.
