### Project: CLInkedIn

CLInkedIn is a desktop address book application made for Recruiting and Hiring Managers. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Add/Delete different kinds of Tags
  * What it does: 
    * Allows the user to add and delete different kinds of tags (e.g. Skills TagType tag, Job Type TagType tag, Degree TagType tag, etc.) to a candidate. 
    * For example, `addTag 2 st/java dt/Bachelors` adds a Skill TagType tag `java` and Degree TagType tag `Bachelors` to the second candidate in the displayed list of candidates.
  * Justification:
    * This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the user to categorise the information of the candidates as relevant tags and view them in a visually pleasing way.
  * Implementation specifications:
    * In order to keep a track of the different kinds of tags for each candidate, the `UniqueTagTypeMap` class was created and a field `tagTypeMap` of reference type `UniqueTagTypeMap` was added to `Person`. Moreover, the `UniqueTagList` class was created in order to keep track of all the tags of a particular `TagType` of a candidate. The `UniqueTagTypeMap` internally uses an `ObservableMap`, backed by a `HashMap`, that maps each `TagType` of the candidate to a `UniqueTagList` of tags.

* **New Feature**: Export/Import
  * What it does:
    * Allows the user to export the displayed list of candidates to the specified location as a JSON/CSV file and import the data of candidates from the specified JSON/CSV file.
    * For example, `export path//Desktop/sample/data.csv` exports the displayed list of candidates to `data.csv` in the `sample` directory of the `Desktop` and `import path//Desktop/sample/data.csv` imports the list of candidates from `data.csv` in the `sample` directory of the `Desktop` to the addressbook.
  * Justification:
      * This feature improves the product significantly as it allows the user to easily transfer the data of the candidates to another device and import it back in the application in the other device.
  * Implementation specifications:
    * In order to read and write to CSV files, the **OpenCSV** parser library was used.
    * UI components `ExportWindow` and `ImportWindow` were created in order to make the Export and Import process more convenient for the user.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * Extended the `add` command to support the addition of different kinds of tags while adding a candidate.
  * Extended the `edit` command to support the modification of the existing tags belonging to a candidate.
