### Project: Friendnancial

Friendnancial is a desktop contact management application used by
financial advisors to manage their clients and contacts. The user
interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java and has about 10 kLoC.

**Summary of Contributions:**

- **New Feature**: Integrate `Insurance` and `Reminders` into the GUI
  * What it does: display critical information on the GUI.
  * Justification: This feature extends the functionality of the CLI application as a user can immediately view upcoming appointments and contact's
  insurance at a glance.
  * Highlights:  There were issues with how the information can be displayed appropriately because of the bug with relation to how JavaFX's
  SplitPane deals with resizing of the window. This was highly challenging because there was not enough documentation that gives explicit reasons
  as to why this is the case. Thus, the SplitPane had to be fixed in place.
