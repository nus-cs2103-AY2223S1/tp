### Project: GREWZ

GREWZ is an all-in-one desktop application to assist teaching assistants in their day-to-day teaching duties.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Create students' profiles based on limited student information.
  * What it does: This makes certain information fields optional to fill in, so that teacher assistants can create a profile for the students without needing to know/fill in all information.
  * Justification: This feature helps teacher assistants to add student's profile flexibly based on the limited student information that they have on their students.
  * Highlights: Optional fields (Class Group, Email, Phone Number, Attendance List) can be left blank. Teaching assistants can use the edit feature if they want fill in those optional fields in the future.

* **New Feature**: Added deadlines to Task Book.
  * What it does: This allows teaching assistants to add in their daily tasks and their deadlines, so that it will remind them to complete the task before it expires.
  * Justification: Some tasks are time-sensitive, therefore it is important to note down the deadline, so that it can act as a reminder to complete the task.
  * Highlights: The deadline of a task can be changed using the edit-task feature.
