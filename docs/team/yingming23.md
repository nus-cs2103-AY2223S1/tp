### Project: SoCompiler

SoCompiler is the sole app that university students will need to streamline their everyday routines. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:

  * **Delete Module**
      * What it does: Delete Module 
      * Justification: After a semester is over, or if the student is not taking the module anymore, they would need to be able to delete the module from the list.
  * **Sync with NUSMods**  
      * What it does: Automatically update module title from input module code
      * Justification: Ease of use for the user.
      * Highlights: Ability to immediately get title with just the module code.
      * Credits: Parsing of NUSMods Json file done by `@avock`.
