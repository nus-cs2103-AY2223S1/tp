### Project: NUScheduler

NUScheduler is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NUScheduler can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
