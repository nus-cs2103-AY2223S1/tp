**Arrow** is a **desktop app** that **help software project managers keep track of their membersâ€™ tasks and deliverables**.
By associating tasks to specific team members, users can **keep track of what needs to be done and have quick access to
contact information should they wish to reach out to the member**.

### Summary of Contributions:
#### [Code contributed](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=beetee17&breakdown=true)

#### Enhancements implemented
- Implemented the `task list`, a fully-featured command for filtering the tasks list by numerous criteria
- Implemented the `task do ... by/` command for setting deadlines to a task.
  - Used the [`PrettyTime NLP` library](https://www.ocpsoft.org/prettytime/nlp/) for an improved user experience as it allows users to specify deadlines in plain English.
- Various GUI components such as:
  - Separating the bottom panel into two panels (for task list and address book)
  - Task checkboxes which indicate completion status and allows users an alternative way to `mark` and `unmark` tasks without typing in the command.
