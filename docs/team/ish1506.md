### Project: InterNUS

InterNUS is a convenient and powerful desktop app, created to help **NUS CS students manage their internship applications.**
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI),
and complemented with a simple yet intuitive Graphical User Interface (GUI)
designed to help you keep track of all your applications at a glance.

Below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:  Added the ability to sort internships by a given criteria.
    * What it does: Allows the user to re-order the internships in InterNUS by a sorting criteria of their choosing (company name, interview date or internship status).
    * Justification: Users may want to sort internships by upcoming interview dates to plan their interview preparation for different companies. Sorting by company names or internship statuses organizes the internship list.
    
* **New Feature**: Added the ability to use shortcuts when specifying internship statuses.
    * What it does: For the `add internship` and `edit internship` commands, the user can use `s/B` (case-insensitive) in place of `s/BOOKMARKED` to specify the status of the internship. Likewise for the other statuses, the first letter suffices.
    * Justification: Shortcuts save time for users once they get familiar with the different internship statuses.
