### Project: Gim

Gim is a **desktop app for managing gym exercises, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Gim builds on the commands of Vim so if you can type fast and are an avid Vim user, Gim can optimize your exercise routines to a much greater capacity than traditional GUI apps.
