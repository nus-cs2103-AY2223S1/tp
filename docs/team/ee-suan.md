### Project: Gim

* Gim is a **desktop app for managing gym exercises, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Gim allows you to keep track your exercises and Personal Records in a efficient way.
  Example usages:
    * as a tracking tool to keep track of completed exercises
    * as a tracking tool to keep track of your personal records
    * as a workout generator to generate exercises based on your personal records

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Generate command ([PR #118](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/pull/118))
    * What it does: Generates workout suggestions for users based on their personal records, based on difficulty level specified.
    * Justification: This feature makes use of the information provided by users to generate a personalised workout session. It makes sensible use of users' personal records.
    * Highlights:
        * Applied Command pattern in designing how the suggested workout is generated.
        * Supports both indexes and exercise names as input.
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ee-suan&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
