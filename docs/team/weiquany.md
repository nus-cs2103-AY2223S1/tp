# Rapportbook

Financial advisors (FA) rely on a large client base for their job. Rapportbook helps new FAs be effective in managing and engaging their clients, by solving the following problems:
- Inefficient use of time
- Motivational issues
- Tracking information about clients
- Hard to promote success status online

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=weiquany&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
- **New feature**: Reminders (mainly backend)
  - What it does: Allows the user to create client specific reminders with a given description and date time.
  - Justification: We want to offer financial advisors a simple way to keep track of their client meetings.
  - Highlights: Reminders are automatically sorted by earliest date time.
- **New feature**: ShowCommand (mainly backend)
    - What it does: Allows the user to view client specific information on a separate panel. Users can also perform other commands in a faster manner for the client shown.
    - Justification: This feature allows the user to edit information, and manage tags and reminders for the client shown, without the need to specify an index for those commands.
    - Highlights: Integration with other commands (edit, tag, reminder).
- **Enhancement**: Command aliasing
    - What it does: Heavily used commands are abbreviated to allow a user to perform actions even faster.
    - Justification: Make the typing experience better for users.
- **Contribution to team-based tasks**
    - Adding demo screenshots for v1.2 in project document on google docs.
