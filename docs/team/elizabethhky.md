### Project: PetCode

PetCode is a software app that aims to facilitate better working experience and boost business management efficiency
for pet sale coordinators. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written
in Java, and has about 30 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Extended the Delete Command to three categories: Delete Buyer Command, Delete Supplier Command and Delete Deliverer Command.
    * What it does: allows the user to delete different types of contacts at the specified index.
    * Justification: This allows the user to delete contacts that have become outdated.
    * Credits: The code was inspired by the original code given in AB3.

* **New Feature**: Extended the Delete Command for two more categories: Delete Order Command and Delete Pet Command.
    * What it does: allows the user to delete an order or pet at the specified index.
    * Justification: This allows the user to delete orders that have been completed and pets that are no longer available for sale.
    * Credits: The code was inspired by the original code given in AB3.

* **Functionality**: Added the classes `UniqueOrderIdPredicate` and `UniquePetIdPredicate`.
  * What it does: these classes increases testability when testing for unique Orders and unique Pets.
  * Justification: Orders and Pets can easily be distinguished by their UniqueId. Hence, when testing for a unique Order or Pet, their UniqueId can be used.
