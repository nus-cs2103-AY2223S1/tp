### Project: NUSEatWhere

NUSEatWhere is a Command Line (CLI) application which helps you search for the available food options in NUS and thus make an informed decision on where to eat.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the `tag` command.
  * What it does: Allows users to give searchable tags containing custom names to eateries.
  * Justification: Improves the customizability of NUSEatWhere because users can display further information on eateries that may be important to them, and to expand their search criterias beyond the given eatery components.


* **New Feature**: Added the `untag` command.
  * What it does: Allows users to remove tags from eateries.
  * Justification: Improves the flexibility of NUSEatWhere because should users make a mistake in typing the tag names or find that the information is no longer relevant, they can simply remove those tags and add them back.


* **New Feature**: Implemented random feature for `find` command.
  * What it does: Gives users the option to randomly select a given number of eateries meeting the given constraints.
  * Justification: Users may have trouble deciding on a few options and don't want to take a long time, so they can use this feature as a 3rd-party tiebreaker to decide faster. It can also enhance user experience through offering surprise outcomes.
  * Credits: This feature was proposed by Charles.


* **Refactoring**:
  *  Renamed all uses of 'storage' in packages, classes and tests to 'foodguide'.
