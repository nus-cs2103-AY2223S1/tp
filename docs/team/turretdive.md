### Project: uNivUSal

uNivUSal is a desktop application used to link CS2103T users to all the modes of communication of other users to make their lives easier. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added an Occupation field for a person.
  * Justification: This helps to differentiate between the target group users (Students, Professors and TAs of CS2103T).

* **New Feature**: Added a Social field for a person which will contain all the different social media accounts of a person in uNivUSal.
  * Justification: This helps to oversee all the different social media account each person has to allow users to choose which social media they would like to contact their contacts through.

* **New Feature**: Added an `include` command that allows the user to add a social media account to an existing contact.
  * What it does: Allows the user to add the social media account information of a person to an existing contact.
  * Justification: This is part of the functionality for the added Social field which allows the user to update the Social field of a person contact by adding the person's social media account information.

* **New Feature**: Added an `exclude` command that allows the user to delete a social media account of an existing contact.
  * What it does: Allows the user to delete a specific social media account information of an existing contact.
  * Justification: This is part of the functionality for the added Social field which allows the user to update the Social field of an existing contact by deleting one of the person's social media account information due to a user mistake when inputting.

* **New Feature**: Added a `prefer` command that allows the user to set the preferred mode of communication of an existing contact.
  * What it does: Allows the user to set a specific social media as an existing contact's preferred mode of communication.
  * Justification: This is part of the functionality for the added Social field which allows the user to update the Social field of an existing contact by setting one of the person's social media as the preferred mode of communication.

* **New Feature**: Added an `open` command that allows the user to open a link to the contact's social media accounts.
  * What it does: Allows the user to open the link to a specific social media account of an existing contact.
  * Justification: This is part of the functionality for the added Social field which allows the user to go straight to a social platform and contact the person immediately

* **New Feature**: Added the Social boxes of a person on the GUI to display all the contact's Social media information.
  * Justification: This is part of the functionality for the added Social field which allows the user to quickly see all the contact's social media platforms and what mode of communication the contact prefer

* **New Enhancement**: Enhanced the Social boxes of a person on the GUI to become buttons
  * What it does: Clicking the buttons has the same effect as the `open` command, which opens the link to the social media account of an existing contact.
  * Justification: This is part of the functionality for the added Social field which allows the user to immediately start communicating with the person through the selected social media.
