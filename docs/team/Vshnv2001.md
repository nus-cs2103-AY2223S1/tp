### Project: githubContact

githubContact is a one-stop desktop app for Program Managers to keep
track of their team's various contact details using simple CLI Commands. 

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature - Delete Attribute Command**: Allowed the user to delete specified
attribute of a person given a valid argument except name, in the case that their 
contact becomes outdated. Did testing for both DeleteAttributeCommand and
DeleteAttributeCommandParser.

* **New Feature**: Added a Role attribute to Person so Program managers can keep track of their teammates' roles.

* **Code contributed**:[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=Vshnv2001)

* **Documentation**:
  * For the UG, I wrote part of the instructions to use the Delete Attribute Command, including some examples
