### Project: FABook

FABook is your **dependable assistant** who **reminds you of meetings** and **consolidates crucial information** like financial plans and client information right at your fingertips! You can now focus on giving your full attention to your clients without having to worry about things slipping your mind.

**FABook is optimized for a financial adviser to use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, FABook can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
