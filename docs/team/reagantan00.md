### Project: FABook

FABook is for mid-tier financial advisors who have to manage many current and potential clients. They often have trouble scheduling client meet-ups for both time and location as they have difficulty keeping track of clients’ information (name, address, portfolio).
They want a product to store all this information in one place.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Logic needed to fetch the earliest meeting time: PRs [#133](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T10-2/tp/pull/133)
    * What it does: Fetches the earliest meeting from a Person
    * Justification: To show a person's earliest meeting time on the UI for PersonCard on PersonListPanel
    * Highlights: Correct earliest meeting time displayed
    * Credits: Reused code from [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5793039)
