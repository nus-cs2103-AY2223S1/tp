# Project: Condonery

Condonery is a desktop app made for property agents primarily used for managing client contacts and condo listings.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Condonery can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### New Features implemented:

- New Feature: Add **PropertyStatusEnum** as a Property Field (Pull Request [#115](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/115))
  - What it does: allows Properties to have PropertyStatus of `AVAILABLE`, `PENDING`, and `SOLD`
  - Justification: This allows the user to know a property's status which is important when doing recommendations to clients

- New Feature: Added the ability to filter by PropertyStatusEnum (Pull Request [#115](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/115))
  - What it does: allows the user to filter properties by their respective status (`AVAILABLE`, `PENDING`, `SOLD`).
  - Justification: This feature improves the user experience of Condonery because it allows the user to
  know which properties are `AVAILABLE`, `PENDING` or `SOLD` without scrolling through all the properties listed
  - Highlights: This enhancement creates a new command. It requires the parser to identify a new prefix and perform
validation to ensure that the input provided is valid.

- Create `Add`, `Delete` and `Edit` commands for `Property` and `Client` classes
