### Project: uNivUSal

uNivUSal is a desktop application used to link CS2103T users to all the modes of communication of other users to make their lives easier. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 20 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added a history command that allows the user to navigate to previous commands using up/down keys.
  * What it does: allows the user to see up to their last five previous commands typed.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to see what they have typed beforehand if they do not remember.
  * Highlights: This enhancement uses a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) data structure in the form of a queue to present the command history.

* **New Feature**: Added a profile picture that changes accordingly to whatever the contact's occupation is.
  * What it does: allows the user to see easily what the occupation is for each contact in a pictorial form.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product because a user may want to know what roles all their contacts hold at a glance.
  * Highlights: This enhancement uses new images saved into the resources folder to be bundled into the JAR file and a function to determine the right image to display.

* **New Enhancement**: Enhanced the delete command to be multi-functional.
  * What it does: allows the user to not just delete contacts but also delete specific fields of people.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to update contacts that no longer use those fields.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands and validators. Required changes to GUI also to display the deleted data field.
