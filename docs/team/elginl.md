### Project: JeeqTracQer

JeeqTracQer is a desktop application that drives the backend of small business owners, helping them to keep track of transactions and points of contact for clients they interact with.
It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.
