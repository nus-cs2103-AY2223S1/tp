### Project: JeeqTracker

JeeqTracker is a desktop application created for **home-based business owners / resellers** that helps them manage the clients
that they interact with by keeping track of their **`BUY / SELL`** transactions, and **`REMARKS`** of clients.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to `view` specific clients
    * What it does: allows the user to view the transactions and remarks of a specific client, which also filters the client list panel to
        left only that specific client.
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to populate the transaction list panel and remark list panel according to the client that the user wants
  to see in details. 


* **New Feature**: Added ability to receive `help` within the application 
    * What it does: allows the user to have a detailed explanation of any commands within the application, or have a summary of all existing commands. This helps users who may
        be forgetful, and reduces the need to open up a separate browser to read the user guide.
    * Justification: This feature increases the convenience of users, and speeds up the process of recalling the usage of certain commands.


* **New Feature**: Added ability to `delete` a specific client, transaction, or remark
    * What it does: allows the user to delete a client, transaction, or remark of their choice.
    * Justification: Essential operation for the application to be useful, as users might add an entry wrongly. Providing a delete functionality will solve such problems.
