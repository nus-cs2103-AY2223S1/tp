## Project: idENTify
### Overview
IdENTify is a **desktop app made for Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) administrative staff to manage patients' contact details
and appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, idENTify can get your patients/appointments' management tasks
done faster than traditional GUI apps.

### Summary of Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

Code contributed: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=guanzhou03&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
Enhancements implemented:
* `delete` command enhancement: Allows deletion of patients in a range, and not just a single deletion at an index.
* `Singleton` pattern: Made use of singleton pattern to keep track of the current predicate shown in the UI (there should only be 1 "global" predicate)
* `cancel` command: Allows removal of a person's appointment from the appointment list.
* `hide patients` command: Allows the model to hide patients based on conditions specified e.g hide by patient names or tags, makes use of the singleton.
* `hide appts` command: Allows the model to hide appointments based on conditions specified e.g hide by appointment tags, status or reason, makes use of the singleton.
* `unhide patients` command: Allows the mode to unhide previously hidden patients based on conditions specified e.g unhide by tags.
* `unhide appts` command: Allows the model to unhide previously hidden appointments based on conditions specified e.g unhide by marked status.
The global predicate to show/hide which appointments and patients was difficult to implement, because hide/unhide has to work with other commands such as find and edit,
and a global predicate for the model must be maintained at all times. e.g hide/find/edit/unhide commands work on the current shown list instead of the full list of appointments and patients, and so the predicate has to be constantly combined, leading to many bugs.

* Updated screenshot for `help` command.
* Updated command summary.
* Added glossary of terms to define.
