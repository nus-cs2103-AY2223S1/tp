### Project: CLInkedIn

CLInkedIn is a desktop application made for recruiters to manage candidates.
CLInkedIn operates mainly using a Command Line Interface (CLI), but still has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) made with JavaFX for improved user experience.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Add Status attribute of a Person**
    * Added ability to indicate which stage of application the candidate is at. 
    * Purpose: As an applicant tracking system, a crucial feature is to enable recruiters to view the application stage of each candidate at a glance.
    * It is a compulsory attribute of a candidate, as every candidate has an application status.
    * Implementation specifications: 
      * Status is internally implemented as a String. 
      * Status is implemented as a compulsory attribute under a `Person` object. Thus, a `Status` object class is created and added to `Person` as a field. 

* **Add Rating attribute of a Person**
    * Added ability to indicate a numerical representation of desirability (ie Rating) of candidates. 
    * Purpose: There are some candidates that are more preferable than others. Thus, the Rating feature is added as part of efforts to implement a numerical system to compare between candidates to decide who should progress to the next stage. 
    * Rating is an integer between 1 and 10 inclusive.
    * It is a non-compulsory attribute of a candidate, as the recruiter might not have enough information to rate the candidate at the point of application.
    * Implementation specifications: 
      * Rating is internally implemented as an Integer. 
      * Rating is implemented as a non-compulsory attribute under a `Person` object. Thus, a `Rating` object class is created and added to `Person` as a field.
      * For candidates with no rating, it is internally represented as having a `Rating` of `0`. However, it is not shown in the external interface.

* **Add Sorting feature**
    * Allows ordering of all candidates from the highest rating to the lowest rating.
    * Purpose: Recruiters can view all candidates in order of desirability.
    * The candidates with no rating will be placed at the bottom, as there is not enough information to compare them with the rest of the applicant pool.
    * Implementation specifications: 
      * A `Comparator<Person>` is created to compare `Rating` between 2 candidates. 
      * All candidates go through the comparator, and a sorted list is obtained.
