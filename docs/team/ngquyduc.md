### Project: HobbyList

HobbyList is a desktop application used for tracking various hobby activities. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. The application is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to `find` activities by `tag`, or by `status` (Pull request [#61](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/61) and [#95](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/95))
  * What it does: These features allow the user to find a specific task with keywords, tag names or status.
  * Justification: When users have a lot of activities in the HobbyList, it will be quite cumbersome having to scrolling to find the needed activity. Using these find features, the user can find the activities more easily.
  *
* **New Feature**: Added new feature to `select` a specific activity (Pull request [#104](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/104) and [#121](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-3/tp/pull/107))
  * What it does: This feature allows the user to view the detailed information about the selected activity.
  * Justification: Sometimes, there are tasks having a very long name, description, or review written by the users. Then, these tasks are not displayed fully in the Activity box in the HobbyList. This feature might come handy for displaying all the details to the user.
