### Project: SETA

SETA is a desktop tutorial management application used to help CS2103T TA's to track their students’ and tutorials’
details, and questions asked by students. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add a student.
    * What it does: Allows the user to add in the name, email and telegram handle of a student.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can keep track of his or her
      students under him.
    * Highlights: This enhancement requires me to make changes to existing classes.


* **New Feature**: Added the ability to edit a student's details.
    * What it does: Allows the user to edit the student's name, email or telegram handle.

      details if he or she keyed in the wrong details at the start or if the student makes any changes during the
      semester.

      the students he or she has.
