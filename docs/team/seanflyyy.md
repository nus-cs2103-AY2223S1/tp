### Project: Teacher's Pet

Teacher’s Pet is a desktop application for managing contacts of students and classes, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Teacher’s Pet can get your contact and class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added find by tag feature
  * What it does: Allows searching up of students based on their tags.
  * Justification: This feature allows for users to find students based on tags which is an integral part of our
  application. Without this feature, the tags would be much less helpful.
  * Highlights: The user is able to input multiple tags in order to find students who contain more than one tag.

* **New Feature**: Added find by next of kin phone feature
  * What it does: This feature allows for users to find students based on their next of kin phone number, providing 
  another way for users to find their students.
  * Justification: This feature provides users with an alternative way of finding students, making the find command
  more dynamic.
  * Highlights: The find by next of kin phone feature would search for the exact match of the student's next of kin 
  phone number.

* **New Feature**: Add Schedule List Panel and styled UI
  * What it does: Improve readability and user experience. Schedule List Panel display persistent schedule for ease of 
  reference.
  * Justification: This feature speeds up the workflow of the user as they can reference the schedule list to know what
  students they have in the day and can quickly find out information like the phone, address and class date time of the
  student without searching the student up directly. Moreover, users are able to perform their other tasks and have a
  static reference point should they ever need to view their schedule.
  * Highlights: The schedule list will refresh automatically whenever there are changes made to the student list panel.

* **New Feature**: Attempted to add the ability to find the next available class **(not included in the final product)**
  * What it does: Outputs the next available class based on the specified time range and duration of class.
  * Justification: This feature is an integral part of this application as without it, it will be really tedious
    for the user to find an available class, and the schedule feature of the application will not be complete.
  * Highlights: Finding the next available class in the specified requirements is much faster than manually checking
    each day until the user finds the slot he/she wants.
