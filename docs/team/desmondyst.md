### Project: FindMyIntern

**Overview**: FindMyIntern is a desktop application that helps students keep track of internship applications. It allows students to consolidate all these applications into a single place, manage these applications, and visualise their application statuses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. FindMyIntern is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=desmondyst&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**: 
  * Added new feature `mark`
    * What it does: Allows the user to mark a specific internship application with an application status
    * Justifications: The user will want to be able to keep track of the current status of his/her internship applications. This is crucial in making other features such as `filter` and `sort` possible
  * Implemented `InterviewDateTime`
    * What it is: Represents the interview's date and time of a particular internship application
    * Key field in saving internship applications
    * Highlights: This is an optional field. As such, I had to take extra care in making sure that this field is stored and retrieved properly from the local storage
  * Enhanced `add` feature
    * Changes: Allows the user to add multiple internship applications for the same company
    * Justifications: The user can apply for multiple roles at the same company
  * Enhanced `edit` feature
    * Changes: Allows the user to modify an internship's interview date and time through the `edit` command 
    * Justifications: It is quite common for the interview's date and time of an internship to change

* **Contributions to the UG**: 
  * Added documentation for `mark` feature
  * Updated documentation for `edit` feature
  * Added section on "Command Line Guide"
    * Useful for new users that are not familiar with command line interface
    * Provides users with a quick guide on how to use command line in FindMyIntern, without diving deep into it
  * Contributed to table of contents

* **Contributions to the DG**: 
  * Added implementation of `mark` and `edit` feature
    * Included activity diagram and design considerations for feature
  * Added use cases for `add`, `mark`, `find`, `filter`
  * Updated diagrams from AB3 to reflect FindMyIntern

* **Contributions to team-based tasks**: 
  * Added GitHub issues and milestones
  * Tagged issues and PRs with relevant tags
  * Reviewed and fixed bugs submitted by testers

* **Review/mentoring contributions**: 
  * Reviewed teammatesâ€™ PRs and merged them
