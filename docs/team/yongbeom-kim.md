### Project: DevEnable

DevEnable is a product for developers who have to manage different projects spread across multiple GitHub repositories. It helps developers organize information about different projects they are working on in one place so that they may prioritize and have an overview. It removes the hassle of having to navigate to our/organizationâ€™s GitHub repo every time and manually check different pages to see which tasks require immediate attention.

Below are my contributions to the project.
