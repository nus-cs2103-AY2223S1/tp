### Project: Survin

Survin is a desktop application for surveyors to use to keep track of people they have surveyed. The surveyor can easily follow up with people they have surveyed for additional information or for confirmation. The user interacts with the application using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view surveyees with given attributes.
  * What it does: allows the user to search for surveyees via attributes.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user may want to filter all surveyees of a given demographic, say, chinese christian females.
  * Highlights: Able to search for exact phrases by using quotation marks on the specific phrase. Also allows multiple worded inputs for a more exhaustive search, which went through many buggy iterations before the final product.

* **Updated Feature**: `help` command
  * What it does: Added functionality of help to show information for each command in Survin. 
  * Justification: New users may be unfamiliar with command usage, especially those with many parameters. `help <COMMAND>` provides a useful tool to help new users get accustomed to using Survin.
  * Highlights: Also designed a simple UI to display the information and allowed team members to easily modify the help message for their implemented command.

* **Updated Feature**: Update persons to allow for multiple `survey` objects.
  * What it does: A surveyee in Survin can keep track of multiple surveys.
  * Justification: This is to make for a more pleasant user interface, rather than having the same person card repeated in Survin for each different Survey they participate in.
