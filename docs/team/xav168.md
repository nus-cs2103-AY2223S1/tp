### Project: NutriGoals

NutriGoals is a desktop app targeted at NUS students who wish to adopt a healthier lifestyle by tracking the user’s diet and calorie consumption. Studies have shown the benefits of keeping
track of your daily food consumption – the more consistent you are, the more likely you are to achieve the various
fitness goals that you have set for yourself! With NutriGoals, you can keep track of your consumption quickly and easily, without
worrying about organising your data.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**:
  * `Setup` (PR [#60](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/60))
    * What it does: Initializes user profile so that the user can make use of the suggest command.
    * Justification: This feature is necessary to obtain the user's information so that we can calculate accurately what is a good target weight as well as other indicators of health such as BMI.
* **New Feature**:
  * `Find` (PR [#93](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/pull/93)) -Done partially with Ruiqi
    * What it does: Finds the item, checks and calculates the average calories of food item with that name.
    * Justification: Many calorie trackers out there either does not provide any data on calories for food items, or uses a sample data for food. However the calorie content of those food items changes depending on the portion size. By taking the average, our suggested calorie content of the food item will decrease or increase according to the amount of calories that the user keys in.
