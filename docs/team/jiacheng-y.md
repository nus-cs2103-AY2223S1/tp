### Project: TrackO 

**TrackO** is a desktop application that helps small home-based business owners manage their orders and inventory efficiently
in the form of an integrated solution built using Java with around 15 kLOC. The user interacts with the application via a
CLI, and the application responds with its GUI, created with JavaFX.

### Summary of Contributions
* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=jiacheng-y&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Notable Feature: **Mark Order Command**
    * Function: Allow the user to mark orders as paid and/or delivered. This feature also includes reducing inventory 
    item quantities accordingly when an item is marked as delivered, and checking for sufficient stock when a 
    user wants to mark an order as delivered. 
    * Purpose: Unique selling point of our application over traditional Excel sheets. By automating 
    the depletion of quantities in the inventory with every fulfilled order, TrackO reduces the risk of
    human error in the inventory tracking process. 
    * Notable implementation 
      * To accommodate for the use of flags which itself represents a boolean argument (compared to prefixes which 
      mark the start of an argument), `ArgumentMultimap` was generalised to interact with an interface instead of 
      prefixes or flags directly.
      * The implementation of functions to check for sufficient stock in inventory and decrease inventory items 
      according to orders delivered also required a deeper understanding of how the facade design pattern is utilised
      in the previous AB3 and current TrackO structure

    [#127](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/127)

  * Notable Feature/Enhancement: **Add Item Command**
    * Function: Allows the user to add inventory items to the inventory list. 
    * Purpose: Core feature of an application that manages inventory. 
    * Relevant pull request(s): [#61](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/61)

  * Notable Enhancement: **Implement initial Storage and UI support for inventory items**
    * Function: Sets the foundation for saving and displaying inventory items in TrackO. 
    * Purpose: Foundation for future developments of an inventory management application. 
    * Relevant pull request(s): [#67](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/67),
    [#69](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/pull/69)

  * Notable Enhancement: **Clear Command**
    * Function: Allows the user to clear all data in TrackO. 
    * Purpose: This is to allow users to clear all sample data when they are ready to use the application proper.
    * Notable implementation
      * Clear command is implemented as a multilevel command which means that users will be required to respond to a 
      confirmation / cancellation prompt before the command is executed by TrackO. This serves to reduce the risk of 
      users accidentally deleting all their data.
