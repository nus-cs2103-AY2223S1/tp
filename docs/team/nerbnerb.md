### Project: FindMyIntern

**Overview**: FindMyIntern is a desktop application that helps students keep track of internship applications. It allows students to consolidate all these applications into a single place, manage these applications, and visualise their application statuses. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. FindMyIntern is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=nerbnerb&breakdown=true)

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Added new feature `filter`
    * What it does: Allows the user to filter internship applications for specific application statuses
    * Justifications: The user will want to filter for different application statuses according to his/her needs, such as viewing internship applications which he/she has been shortlisted for interviews.
  * Implemented `AppliedDate`
    * What it is: Represents the date which the user applied for an internship
    * Crucial field in saving internship applications
  * Overhauled GUI
    * Updated FindMyIntern to a more modern user interface
    * Rearranged and resized elements to better suit users' needs
  * Enhanced `add` feature to accept `InterviewDateTime`
    * What it does: Allows the user to include an optional interview date/time while adding internship applications
    * Automatically sets internship application status to "Shortlisted" instead of default "Applied"
  * Helped rewrite sample data which appears on first startup of FindMyIntern
    * Modified to be more realistic to how internship applications will be added

* **Contributions to the UG**:
  * Integrated Bootstrap 5 into user guide
  * Added documentation for `filter` feature
  * Added tutorial section "Adding your first internship application"
    * Useful for new users familiarising themselves with FindMyIntern
    * Annotated UI for new users
  * Added comparison between `filter` and `find` commands
    * Useful as both commands are similar
  * Added section for UI elements
    * Explains purpose of certain elements which may be less obvious
