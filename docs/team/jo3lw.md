### Project: JeeqTracker

JeeqTracker is a desktop application created for **home-based business owners / resellers** that helps them manage the clients
that they interact with by keeping track of their **`BUY / SELL`** transactions, and **`REMARKS`** of clients.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added ability to `sort` specific clients
    * What it does: This feature displays the sorted transactions of a specified client based on date of transaction.
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to view what transactions they have made recently instead of having to search through a long list of transactions.

* **New Feature**: Added `Date` feature to transactions
    * What it does: This feature allows users to tag valid dates to translations.
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to know which transaction was made on which date.

* **New Feature**: Added `buy` and `sell` parsers
    * This feature converts the user input for buy/sell command to be create a corresponding buy/sell command.
    * Justification: This feature is essential for users to input transactions so that our application can keep track of them.
