## Project: Travelr
Travelr allows you to plan trips around the activities in your bucket list. You will be able to keep track of your bucket list, travel dates, locations, and itineraries, all within the same app!

## Contributions

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view the summary of travels a User has completed.
  * What it does: allows the user to view all his completed trips and statistics related to his travel completion. Brings up a new window which shows the completed trips, percentage of trips and events completed, and unique locations visited.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can reflect on the percentage of their bucket list events they have actually completed. It also allows the user to celebrate his unique locations visited and number of trips completed, enhancing the satisfaction of clearing his bucket list.
  * Highlights: This enhancement forms a key component of the app's enjoyment, by allowing the user to be satisfied with his progress. It required major UI additions, including a new window to display the summary statistics and information. The implementation was moderately difficult as it required several changes to different components of the app, which included the addition of an observable SummaryVariable class which the GUI depends on.

* **New Feature**: Added ObservableTrip
  * What it does: A wrapper of the Trip class where its attributes (such as Title, and Description) are `SimpleStringProperty`.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product as it allows us to implement the Selected Trip GUI. 
  * Highlights: This enhancement forms a key component of the app's functionality, by allowing the selected trip GUI to display individual trips. It required several new methods to be implemented by the Model interface in order to update and manage the observable trip. The implementation was moderately difficult as it was the first time the team was displaying a separate UI component outside of the Trip List and Event list.

* **New Feature**: Selected Trip GUI
  * What it does: Displays the selected trip in the GUI.
  * Justification: Allows the user to have a constant reference to what the current selected trip is, so that they would know if the event list is displaying the bucket list events or the selected trip's event.

* **New Feature**: Added SummaryVariables
  * What it does: Stores a few properties which is used in the Summary command GUI.
