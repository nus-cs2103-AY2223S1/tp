### Project: `CLIMods`

`CLIMods` is a native desktop application for NUS students to explore, manage and plan academic
modules that they are interested in taking. Power users of the command line/terminal will be able to
plan and manage their modules much faster than doing it on [nusmods.com](https://nusmods.com).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

_To be added soon_
