### Project: TABS

TABS is a desktop scheduler application used by students managing team projects. It allows the user who is a student to view a project's members and their workload, allocate tasks to them
and get reminders on upcoming deadlines or deliverables.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: `DisplayGroupCommand` [`#86`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/86)
  * This command class fetches the group as specified by the user.
  * This helps the user to locate a particular group and have a quick glance at its corresponding members in the group
  * The `FullGroupNamePredicate` class is created to facilitate the checking the equality of the group specified and every group stored on TABS.
  * Facilitated with the addition of `SplitPane` to display the list of groups.

*  **New Feature** : `ListGroupsCommand` [`#107`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/pull/107)
   * This command class shows all the groups that are stored on TABS.
   * This helps the user to have a quick glance on all the existing groups created.
