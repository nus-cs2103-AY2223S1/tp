### Enhancements implemented

**Auto-complete feature**
I spent a lot of time researching and implementing the auto-complete feature:
* took advantage of the ControlsFX library and making the necessary changes to the `commandBox` class
* make it look and feel similar to the Minecraft theme used in the application by modifying the css files

**Help Screen**
I implemented the help screen to show the user a list of commands and their descriptions:
* `HelpWindow` class, to implement the help screen
