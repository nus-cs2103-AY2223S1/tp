### Enhancements implemented

**Autocomplete feature**<br>
I spent a lot of time researching and implementing the auto-complete feature:
* took advantage of the ControlsFX library and making the necessary changes to the `CommandBox` class.
* make it look and feel similar to the Minecraft theme used in the application by modifying the css files.

**Help Screen**<br>
I implemented the help screen to show the user a list of commands and their descriptions:
* `HelpWindow` class, to implement the help screen.
* `MainWindow` class, to implement the show help upon startup when the user has no data.
* `HelpWindow` css file, to make it look and feel similar to the Minecraft theme used in the application.
