### Project: PayMeLah

PayMeLah is a desktop app for **keeping track of** and **managing the debts** your friends owe you. It can also help **do simple calculations** for you, such as including GST or splitting debts amongst your friends. Whatâ€™s more, it is optimised for you to do everything from just your keyboard!

Given below are my largest contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented majority of the `paymelah.model.debt` package [#61](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/61), [#129](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/129)
  * What it does: Represents a debt and its associations as classes within the PayMeLah code base.
  * Justification: The package follows the Object-Oriented
  Programming paradigm that is used throughout PayMeLah.
  * Highlights: This package is the core of what makes PayMeLah different from AB-3. `testutil` classes including `DebtBuilder` and `TypicalDebts` were also implemented in conjunction with the `debt` package to improve testability of code. `DebtDate` and `DebtTime` were enhancements added to `Debt` at a later stage, requiring extensive refactoring throughout the PayMeLah code base for both functional code and test code to prevent regressions.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the `adddebt` command [#80](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/80), [#98](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/98), [#153](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/153)
  * What it does: allows the user to add debts to the persons in PayMeLah, enabling them to track information related to the debts such as a description, money amount, date and time.
  * Justification: This is the core feature of PayMeLah that enables users to keep track of debts and associate them with the persons who own the debts.
  * Highlights: Use of OOP ensures that changes made to the validity of user inputs relating to `debt` classes such as the `<money>` input will not affect the functionality of the code related to `adddebt`. Implementation of automated testing to prevent regressions.

* **New Feature**: Enable calculation of GST/Service Charge when adding debts [#138](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/138)
  * What it does: allows the user to (optionally) specify to include Service Charge and GST in money amounts for debts added to PayMeLah.
  * Justification: This feature helps simplify debt-adding processes for users who are confused about how to calculate GST and Service Charge by doing the calculation for them.
  * Highlights: The final implementation of this feature made use of an elegant design where target users (NUS students) simply have to make use of common Singaporean lingo, a money amount followed `++`, to indicate a need for PayMeLah to calculate GST and Service Charge. Through the use of OOP design and encapsulation, modifications done to the `Money` class to implement this feature did not cause regressions in any other classes that have dependencies with `Money`, enabling the usage of this feature across commands such as `adddebt` and `splitdebt` and ensuring extensibility to future commands.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=waynezsy&tabRepo=AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
  * Managed deadlines and milestones consistently from `v1.1` to `v1.4`.

* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * Refactored the code for multi-index command parsing, including both functional code for commands such as `splitdebt` and `deletedebt` and test code to prevent regressions. [#153](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/pull/153)
