- Writing neat and readable code when implementing features and enhancing the UI.

### Reviewing/mentoring contributions
- Reviewed PRs made by my teammates.
- Provided help to team members when finding errors in code and solving bugs

### Contributions beyond the project team
- I posted a question on the forum when I faced a problem that was Mac-related, as I foresee that this issue would be faced by other Mac users.
- I did not post any answers to the questions posted by other students on the forum, but I believe the question I posted would help others greatly.
