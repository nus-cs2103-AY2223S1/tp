### Project: GREWZ

GREWZ is a desktop address book application used for teaching Software Engineering principles. The user interacts with it using a Command line Interface (CLI), and it has a Graphic User Interface (GUI) created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Implemented the *attendance feature* of GREWZ
    * What it does: Assist the user in keeping track of attendance of students. The user can create or delete an attendance list for each student. The user can mark and umark attendance of students.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because teacher assistants can easily monitor students' attendance in one application and do not need to rely on third party applications to keep track of students. Having the details stored locally ensures that student data is not leaked to other vendors. Teacher assistants also can see if students are struggling to attend class and provide checks on them. 
    * Highlights: This enhancement keeps track of each student's attendance.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=evande1&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)

* **Project management**:
