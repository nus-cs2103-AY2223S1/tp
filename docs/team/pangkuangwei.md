### Project: SoConnect

SoConnect is a **contact management and task management desktop app** that aims to help NUS SoC students stay better connected to their school life, both in terms of social connections and school tasks. To better cater to NUS SoC students, SoConnect is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). SoConnect has around 42 kLoC. SoConnect is written in Java and uses JavaFX.
