### Project: PetCode
* **New Feature**: Extended the add person command to three categories: add buyer, deliverer command and supplier command.
    * What it does: allows the user to add persons according to their roles.
    * Justification: This feature is the core feature of this app since all other features are based on it. The user
      cannot do further manipulation of data without adding it.
    * Highlights: This enhancement defines the paradigm of operations on contacts. That is, every person category has
      its
      own command word extension for every command, such as `add-s` and `delete-b`. It guides subsequent implementations
      of other commands.

* **New Feature**: Added the add order command and add pet command.
    * What it does: allows the user to add an order to a buyer and add a pet to a supplier. Even more convenient, the
      user
      can choose to add as many orders as possible when adding a buyer, or add as many pets as possible when adding a
      supplier.
    * Justification: This helps the user organise his/her business by keeping track of orders placed and pets available
      for sale.
    * Highlights: There are a tremendous number of prefixes and attributes to handle, which was not easy.

* **New Feature**: Added the match command.
    * What it does: allow user to find out which pet for sale is the best fit for an order placed by a buyer.
    * Justification: To maximise utility and profit, the user needs to find out the most suitable pet to sell to a buyer
      according to the buyer's demand.
    * Highlights: The algorithm is a score evaluation algorithm that involves some complex calculations. The weight of
      each field is carefully chosen.

* **Functionality**: Implemented many parser utility methods.
    * What it does: provides convenient utility methods to parse strings to other objects and validate data by a variety
      of rules.
    * Justification: Many commands rely on and make use of these methods for convenience, such as the add commands, the
      edit commands, the find commands and the filter commands.
    * Highlights: There are many constraints to consider. For example, some data cannot be negative, some can only be
      alphanumeric, and some cannot be blank. Multiplicity should be well considered too.

* **Functionality**: Wrote data models.
    * What it does: these data models, such as `Pet`, `Age`, `UniqueOrderList`, and `DateOfBirth` abstract real-world
      objects and provide computational paradigms to mimic their interactions.
    * Justification: Without these data models, it would be extremely troublesome to manipulate data.
    * Highlights: The SOLID principles and OOP were employed thoroughly.
* **Functionality**: Added the unique ID system.
* **Functionality**: Discovered a variety of bugs and fixed them. For

* **Project management**:
    * Managed releases `v1.2` - `v1.3(trial)` (2 releases) on GitHub.
    * Assigned teammates to different issues and kept track of their progress.
    * Maintained and updated the official and unofficial meeting minutes after every meeting.
    * Managed milestones, changed their due dates, and closed them to wrap-up.
    * Did final submission of the JAR file, the UG, the DG, and the PPP.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
    * Let the GUI window fit different screen sizes (Pull
      requests [\#296](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/296))
    * Deleted useless classes like `AddCommandParser` and decoupled some classes for higher robustness.

* **Documentation**:
    * User Guide:
        * Adding a buyer, Adding a deliverer, Adding a supplier, Adding a pet to a supplier, Adding an order to a buyer,
          Prefix Summary, FAQs, Other miscellaneous parts and proofreading
    * Developer Guide:
        * Target user profile, Value proposition, User stories, Use cases, Match command implementation, Unique ID
          implementation, Other miscellaneous parts and proofreading

* **Community**:
    * Created the team's organization and team repo
    * Managed issues and allocated tasks to members
    * Set up CodeCov repo
    * PRs reviewed (with non-trivial review comments): [\#145](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/145)
      , [\#174](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-2/tp/pull/115)
    * Contributed to forum discussions (examples: [\#153](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S1/forum/issues/153)
      , [\#73](https://github.com/nus-cs2103-AY2223S1/forum/issues/73))
    * Reported bugs and suggestions for other teams in the class (
