### Project: PennyWise

PennyWise is a desktop application that **empowers students with the ability to make informed financial decisions**, by
providing a graphical analysis of their financial activities. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI
created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to view expense and income entries in a pie chart, sorted by categories via a
  command. (PRs: https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-2/tp/pull/66)
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can easily get a snapshot of their
      budget based on how their spend and earn.
    * Highlights: This enhancement was a key feature of our app, greatly improving usability of our app. It affects
      existing commands and commands to be added in the future. The implementation required changes to existing
      commands, namely the `ViewCommand`.
