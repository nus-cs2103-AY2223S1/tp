### Project: Contactmation

Contactmation is a powerful **desktop based team management solution** that **helps its users efficiently and
effectively manage many projects and groups at once.**

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to add/delete teams.
    * What it does: allows the user to add teams in Contactmation. Preceding add commands can be reversed by using the 
  delete command.
    * Justification: This feature covers the basic functionality of the product.
    * Highlights: This feature was utilised for other components of Contactmation such as Tasks and Contacts.
* **New Feature**: Added group commands.
  * What it does: allows the user to create and navigate through groups.
  * Justification: This is an extension to the attribute `teams`, and it allows further classification of members of projects for users.
  * Highlights: This feature works like 'folders' and scoping is used to create groups within groups for diversification of groups for an organisation.
