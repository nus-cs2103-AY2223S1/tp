### Project: uNivUSal

uNivUSal is a desktop application used to link CS2103T users to all the modes of communication of other users to make their lives easier. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to **sort** entries.
    * What it does: allows the user to sort all persons in uNivUSal
    * Commands: `sort`
    * Justification: This feature improves the navigability for users to traverse through their contacts. It can also be
  integrated with other fields to support future implementation.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to filter entries by preferred social media.
  * What it does: allows the user to list contacts with a specific preferred social media
  * Commands: `social SOCIAL`
  * Justification: This feature improves the navigability for users to filter through their contacts based on their preferred socials. It is also an elaboration on the preferred social feature implemented.

* **New Feature**: Added a tutorial field for a person.
  * Justification: Supports the aim of the app to cater it to CS2103T students and TAs. This field would allow TAs to
  keep track of the students in their tutorial group.

* **New Feature**: Added a **add to favorite group** shortcut.
  * Commands: `fav`
  * Justification: **favorite** would be the basic group a user would need in their contact list.
