### Project: GuestBook

GuestBook is a **desktop app for managing guests in a hotel,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you are a hotel manager who can type fast, GuestBook can get your
guest management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 13 kLoC.
This project is based off AddressBook - Level 3.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added `isRoomClean` field.
  * This field indicates if a room has been cleaned or not.


* **New Feature**: Added `markroomsunclean` command.
  * Allows the user to set the room clean status of all the guest in the hotel to `no` in a single command.
  * This feature greatly aids with GuestBook's efficiency. Typing in one command to change all guests' room
clean statuses saves the user an incredible amount of time compared to individually editing each guest's
details.


* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&tabAuthor=bryanhce&tabRepo=AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)
