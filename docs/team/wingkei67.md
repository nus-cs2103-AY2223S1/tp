## Project: idENTify

### Overview
IdENTify is a **desktop app made for Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) administrative staff to manage patients' contact details
and appointments, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, idENTify can get your patients/appointments' management tasks
done faster than traditional GUI apps.
