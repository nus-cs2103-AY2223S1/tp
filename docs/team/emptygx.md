### Project: CLInkedIn

CLInkedIn is a desktop address book application made for Recruiting and Hiring Managers.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=emptygx&breakdown=true)


* **New Feature**:
  * **Find feature**:
    * What it does: Allows the user to find a candidate by name, phone number, email, address, status, notes, tags.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can look for specific candidates without having to go through the entire list.
    * Highlights: This is an enhancement to the existing find command. Further details on changes found below in the Enhancements section.

  * **Undo/redo feature**:
    * What it does: Allows the user to undo all previous commands one at a time. Preceding undo commands can be reversed by using the redo command.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can make mistakes in commands and the app should provide a convenient way to rectify them.
    * Highlights: This feature only works for commands that modify the state of the list of candidates. The model is used to detect changes in the list of candidates.

  * **Statistics feature**:
    * What it does: Allows the user to view the statistics of the ratings of candidates in the current filtered list through a pie chart.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can view a quick summary of the ratings of candidates, which can be useful for ranking candidates proportionately.
    * Highlights: This feature uses the JavaFX library to create a pie chart. It required an analysis of design alternatives on where to implement calculate the statistics. In the end, it was decided to implement it in the model component.

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * **Find feature**: Updated the find feature to have a general and a prefix-based `find` command.
    * Previously: 
      * The find command only allowed the user to find a candidate by name.
      * The find command was case-sensitive.
      * The find command only allowed the user to find a candidate by the exact name.
    * Now:
      * The find command allows the user to find a candidate by name, phone number, email, address, status, ratings, notes and tags.
        * Prefix-based find command allows the user to specify the field to search for when finding a candidate.
        * General `find` command allows the user to find a candidate by searching in all fields.
      * The find command is case-insensitive.
      * The find command allows the user to find a candidate by partial keywords.
    * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because it makes the find command more flexible and user-friendly.
    * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands and commands to be added in future. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.
