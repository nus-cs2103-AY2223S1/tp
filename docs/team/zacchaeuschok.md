### Project: Condonery

Condonery is a desktop app made for property agents primarily used for managing client contacts and condo listings.
It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, Condonery can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**: Add `find` command for clients and properties (PR [#76](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/76))
  - What it does: Allows user to find property and clients by name.
  - Justification: This feature enables the property agent to search for listings or clients by name easily.

- **New Feature**: Add `filter` by tag commands for clients and properties (PR [#53](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/53))
  - What it does: Allows user to filter the property or client directory based on tag attributes.
  - Justification: This feature enables the property agent to easily identify properties or clients with the same tag.

- **New Feature**: Add `range` command for properties (PR [#88](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/88))
  - What it does: Allows user to filter properties within a lower and upper bound of price range.
  - Justification: This feature enables the property agent to identify suitable properties within budget for their clients.
  - Highlights: This enhancement required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives.
  The implementation too was challenging as it required a user-friendly implementation of the price attribute in the property class.

- **New Feature**: Add `type` command for properties (PR [#111](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-1/tp/pull/111))
  - What it does: Allows user to filter properties by type.
  - Justification: This feature enables the property agent to identify properties by their type e.g. HDB, Condo.
