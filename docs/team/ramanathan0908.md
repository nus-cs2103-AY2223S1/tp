[RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=ramanathan0908&breakdown=true)
* **New feature**: Added the ability to have recurring tasks [PR #252](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/252).
  * What it does: Recurring tasks can be specified with a recurrence, then it would automatically generate the next task once the upcoming task has passed its task date/
  * Justification: Tasks that are recurring can be common for nurses, and it can be tedious for them to manually generate them by adding a new one frequently. Recurring tasks removes the tedious aspect and makes it easier for them
  * Highlights: This feature is essential for nurses as they often have tasks that they have to perform every certain interval. This feature allows them to never forget the task.
* **New feature**: Added the ability to view Tasks for a particular day [PR #207](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/pull/207).
  * What it does: Allows nurses to check what Tasks they have on a particular date.
  * Justification: Private nurses often need to have a overarching view of their duties in a time span so that they can plan and better organise their time.
* **Testing**
  * Wrote Unit and integration tests for Task related classes and some Time based commands.
* **Enhancements to existing features**
  * Added date and time properties to tasks.
  * Tasks can have date and time associated with them, making it easier for the nurses to know when they should be performed.
