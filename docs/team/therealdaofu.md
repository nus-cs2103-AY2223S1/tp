### Project: SoCompiler

SoCompiler is the sole app that university students will need to streamline their everyday routines. The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
<br><br/>
* **Find Commands**:
  * Added Find command for both contacts and modules, namely `findp` and `findm`, as well as their associated classes([PR #95](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/95)).
  * The associated classes include:
    * `FindModuleCommandParser`
    * `FindPersonCommandParser`
    * `ModuleDetailsContainsKeywordPredicate`
    * `PersonDetailsContainsKeywordPredicate`
      <br><br/>

* **About Us and README**
  * Updated [About Us page](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/docs/AboutUs.md) ([PR #43](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/43)) and [README page](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/blob/master/README.md) ([PR #34](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/34)).
    <br><br/>

* **Testing**:
  * Wrote test cases for the following classes:
    * `AddressBookParser`
    * `ListCommand`
    * `FindCommand`
    * `FindModuleCommand`
    * `FindPersonCommand`
    * `FindCommandParser`
    * `FindModuleCommandParser`
    * `FindPersonCommandParser`
    * `ModuleDetailsContainsKeywordPredicate`
    * `PersonDetailsContainsKeywordPredicate`

    <br><br/>

* **Project management**:
  * Created issues to be completed by team for v1.3.
  * Helped to review and close pull requests for other team members.
  * Fixed and closed most issues opened post mock PE and post UG review (cs2101), updated on [team google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OFhvvTXxh97xsj_ng3f3Gmx66HFJV9Pazy5_gCdhT4o/edit#heading=h.c0ehkba6xb9y) on bugs fixed. 
    <br><br/>

* **Enhancements to existing features**:
  * `find` command now searches keyword across both modules and contacts, instead of only contacts
  * All `find` commands now searches not just person name/module code, but all available fields([PR #117](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/117/files)).
  * `list` command now list the entire list for both contacts and modules([PR #89](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/89)).
    <br><br/>

* **Documentation**:
  * User Guide:
    * Helped design the layout of the UG.
    * Fixed majority of bugs found in UG, such as during mock PE([PR #225](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/225))
    * Added sections on Find Commands([PR #129](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/129)), Person fields and Module fields.
  * Developer Guide:
    * Updated DG to its final draft([PR #256](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/256)).
    * Added UML diagrams for find command([PR #111](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/pull/111)).
