### Project: PleaseHireUs

PleaseHireUs (PHU) is a **desktop app for managing internships, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: A statistic bar chart
    * What it does: Provides an overview of the number of applications in each application process using a stacked bar chart.
    * Justification: This is a quality of life feature for users to get a rough idea regarding the state of their applications

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=Elben85&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
