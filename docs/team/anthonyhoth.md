### Project: OmniHealth

OmniHealth is a **Patient Management System** tailored to private clinicians to manage patients' details, records and upcoming appointments.
As a private clinician, you can manage and monitor your patient database all in one location.
Utilise OmniHealth's **sorting and filtering system** to help you easily manage and find your patients' details and records of past visits.
Also, OmniHealth's **appointment tracker** allows you to tag upcoming appointments for each patient.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**: [anthonyhoth's tP Dashboard](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=anthonyhoth&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
* **Enhancements implemented**:
  * **New Feature**: Added `rdelete` command [\#49](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/pull/49)
    * What it does: Allows for users to delete records from a patient's record list.
    * Justification: Having this feature is essential for the application's functionality to allow users to manage records.
    * Highlights: The feature allows for users to delete records in the filtered/unfiltered list based on the index shown.
  * **New Feature**: Added `redit` command [\#79](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-3/tp/pull/79)
    * What it does: Allows for users to edit the date, details or medication field of a record.
    * Justification: Instead of having users to delete and add a new record to replace and existing one, this command allows
them to edit and replace an existing records with new fields.
  * Edited OmniHealth's duplicate check for patients
    * Justification: Patients might have the exact same name, so we defined duplicate patients as having duplicate names and home address.
