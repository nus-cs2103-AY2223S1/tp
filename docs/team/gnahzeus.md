### Project: Teacher's Pet

Teacher’s Pet is a desktop application for managing contacts of students and classes, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Teacher’s Pet can get your contact and class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Added the ability to delete multiple students.
  * What it does: allows the user to delete multiple students in one command.
  * Justification: This feature improves the product significantly because a user can have many students
  * and deleting in a batch as opposed to entering the delete command repeatedly greatly improves efficiency and
  * contributes to a smoother user experience.
  * Highlights: This enhancement affects existing commands. It required an in-depth analysis of design alternatives. The implementation too was challenging as it required changes to existing commands.

* **New Feature**: Search by address.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense Link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=&sort=totalCommits%20dsc&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16&tabOpen=true&tabType=authorship&zFR=false&tabAuthor=gnahzeus&tabRepo=AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-4%2Ftp%5Bmaster%5D&authorshipIsMergeGroup=false&authorshipFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&authorshipIsBinaryFileTypeChecked=false&authorshipIsIgnoredFilesChecked=false)

* **Project management**:
