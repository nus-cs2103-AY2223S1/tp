### Project: HR Pro Max++

HR Pro Max++ is a desktop team management application for SME company to manage their team members and project details.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX.
It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Converted AB3 to HR Pro Max++.
    * What it does: AB3 is converted to a project management application titled HR Pro Max++. All commands in AB3 (e.g. adding, removing, finding and editing) can be used on projects in HR Pro Max++.
    * Highlights: Projects and persons are two very different objects with different fields. Projects have fields like deadline and budget which persons do not have and hence different validations are required.
    * Credits: Took inspiration from AB3's person object.

* **New Feature**: Enables users to sort the projects in HR Pro Max++.
    * What it does: Allows users to order the projects by deadline.
    * Justification: Users may not add their projects in order of their deadline and very often, they are interested in the projects that have earlier deadline as they are generally more urgent. Hence, there should be a way for users to organise their projects by order of importance, and deadline can be considered to be an indication of importance.

* **New Feature**: Enables users to view members of a particular project
    * What it does: Allows users to view the details of staff members who are currently working on the project of interest.
    * Justification: Every project has its own list of members and hence there should be a way for users to view the staff list of each project.

* **New Feature**: Enables staff list to be automatically saved.
    * What it does: Staff details of each project is immediately saved to storage whenever the user make changes to it.
    * Justification: Users might lose their changes in the event that the application shuts down unexpectedly. Hence, there should be a way that records all changes the user made so that they do not lose any important information.
    * Highlights: Unlike projects, there are multiple staff lists, each tag to a project. Hence, each staff lists is stored as a field in a project. It was quite challenging because we needed to create a way for a collection of models to be stored as a field.

* **New Feature**: Enables users to edit a task in the task list.
    * What it does: Allows users to change one or more details of a task (e.g. description, deadline) that is present in the task list.
    * Justification: The details of a particular task might change (e.g. deadline brought forward) and hence there should be a convenient and efficient way for users to record this change into the task list without having to completely remove and add the task again.
    * Credits: Took inspiration from AB3's edit command.

* **Code contributed**: [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=darren12345677&breakdown=true)

* **Project management**: 
  * Managed releases `v1.2.1` and `v1.3.1` (2 releases) on GitHub

* **Enhancements to existing features**: 
  * Wrote additional test cases for staff list to increase code coverage by 11.23% (Pull request [#73](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-3/tp/pull/73)

* **Documentation**: to be confirmed

* **Community**: to be confirmed

* **Tools**: to be confirmed
