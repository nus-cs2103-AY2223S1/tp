### Project: Yellow Pages
Yellow Pages is a desktop address book application used for students in universities. User interaction is done through CLI and its GUI is created using JavaFX

Given below are my contributions to the project.

- **New Feature**:
  - **Meeting List Storage** [#39](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-3/tp/pull/39)
    - Description: Store meetings created
    - Justification: There is a need to store all meetings that have been created so that the user can access them when they reopen the application.
    - Highlights: The implementation for storing of meetings follows closely with how closely address book is stored. Despite following the way address book is being implemented, 
    it was not as trivial to follow. Changes had to be made to the logic and model managers as that it how the user interacts with the UI. Storage manager and the main app also had to be 
    edited to ensure that an empty meeting list on start up could be populated with sample meetings.
    - Credits: AB3 Address book
    
  - **List Meeting Command** [#33](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-3/tp/pull/33)
    - Description: List all meetings that have been created in the command line
    - Justification: Previously before the UI cards were implemented for storage, there was no way to view all meetings
