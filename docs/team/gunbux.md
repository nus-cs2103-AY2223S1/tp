### Project: Teaching Assistant Assistant

Teaching Assistant Assistant (TAA) is a desktop app for Teaching Assistants (TAs). It keeps track of TAsâ€™ students,
tutorial groups, and tasks.


Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **Code contributed**:
  * [RepoSense link](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=gunbux&breakdown=true&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&since=2022-09-16&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other)
  * [Created Issues/PRs](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-1/tp/issues?q=author%3Agunbux+)

* **Enhancement Added**:
  * **New Feature**: Added the tasks functionality and commands
    * What it does: allows the user to add, delete, edit, and view tasks
    * Using the current AB3 workflow was not possible as we needed to assign students to tasks without interacting 
with the model. Instead, we had to create a new design for Tasks, where we delay the creation of the Task in the Parser
till we are able to search through the student list in model
  * **New Feature**: Added mass actions for index based commands
    * What it does: allows the user to perform an action on multiple students at once
    * This was done by modifying how index-based commands were implemented, alongside some changes to the parser as well.
  * Modified parser and commands to enable two word commands
  * Modified list commands to have sensible outputs

* **Documentation**:
