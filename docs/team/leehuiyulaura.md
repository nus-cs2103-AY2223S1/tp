# Project: ConnectNUS

## Overview
ConnectNUS is a desktop address book application used for NUS CS students to keep track of their own modules,
and their friend's modules and contacts as well.

## Contributions
Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Feature**: Filter Contacts by Tag(s).
  * What it does: Lists out all persons in the contact list that have the tag(s) specified by the user.
  * Justification: To allow you to quickly find all the people belonging to a specific category.
  * Highlights:

  * What it does: Lists out all persons in the contact list that have the current module(s) specified by the user in
    their current modules list.
  * Justification: To allow you to quickly find all the people taking specific module(s).

* **New Feature**: Refreshing User and all Persons in the contact list when a New Semester starts.
  * What it does: Moves all the current modules in the current module lists of both the user and all persons in the user's
    contact list into their previous modules list.
  * Justification: To allow user's to update their ConnectNUS app a new semester starts by clearing all modules from the
    current module lists of the user and their contacts, such that they are able to add new current modules that they
    and their contacts will be taking in the upcoming semester to their app.
