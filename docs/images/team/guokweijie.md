## Project: HealthContact
**Overview**: <br>
HealthContact is a desktop application built for the receptionist of a family clinic who arranges telemedicine services between doctors and patients.
It helps to keep track and manage patient data, appointments and bills, especially for clinics who do not have apps to expedite the process.

Given below are my contributions to the project.
