**CAP 5, Not Capsize.**

**NotionUS is a desktop application for managing your assignments and tasks.** 

While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface). This application is aimed towards tech-savvy university students who need to track their tasks and type fast.

* If you are interested in using NotionUS, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing NotionUS, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
