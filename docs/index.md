**TA-Assist is a desktop application for managing your students' grades.** While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions are performed through a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using TA-Assist, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in developing TA-Assist, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
