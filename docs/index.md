* **Plannit** is an **all-in-one application** that streamlines the execution of module 
  deliverables by **empowering NUS students** with the ability to manage **tasks** (e.g. 
  assignments), **links** (e.g. learning management platforms, Zoom) and **module-mates** (i.e., 
  students in the same module) to increase their productivity.

* While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
