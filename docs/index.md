* This product is for computing students who are comfortable with CLI over GUI and need to **keep track of the statuses of their many internship applications**.<br>
  Example usages:
    * as a digital internship application tracker
    * as an internship interview reminder
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _CinternS_) used for managing internship application details.
    * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
    * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `CinternS` because it serves the purpose of tracking _Computer Science (CS)_ students' _internship_ applications.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
