Swift+ is a **desktop application to track your daily events with contacts.** Combined with an aesthetic GUI, all user interactions happen using swift text-based commands.

- If you are interested in using Swift+, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
- If you are interested about developing Swift+, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
