**What is ModtRekt?**

ModtRekt is a desktop app created for NUS students to have a faster and more organised way to **manage their modules and
tasks**. It ensures that you would **never forget another task or miss another deadline**. This way you can focus on
learning and not be sidetracked by unexpected tasks that you forget. Modtrekt is optimized for use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) for **faster navigation** and input whilst still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI)
.

**To learn more**

* If you are interested in using ModtRekt, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User
  Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested in contributing to the development of ModtRekt, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) 
is a good place to start.
