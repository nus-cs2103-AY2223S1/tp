* WorkBook (WB) is a desktop app for CS/tech students who are applying for internships to manage their internship applications.

* WorkBook (WB) is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, WB can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* If you are interested in using WorkBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing WorkBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
