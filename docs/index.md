**Travelr is a desktop application that allows you to plan trips around the activities in your bucket list.** You will be able to keep track of your bucket list, travel dates, locations, and itineraries, all within the same app!

While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Travelr, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Travelr, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
