**Friendnancial is a desktop application for Financial Advisors to manage their contact details.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
* It is named `Friendnancial` (`Friend` for short) because the application aims to be your friend in the financial space.
* Financial advisors (FA) have many different types of contacts: warm clients, cold clients, normal friends. FAs have to regularly keep up with their contacts, by **wishing them happy birthday**, or **sending invites** and **following up** with contacts, they may do so on multiple platforms such as LinkedIn, Instagram, email. FAs have to **store information about their clients such as contracts and schemes/packages**.
