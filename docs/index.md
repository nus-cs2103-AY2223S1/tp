**TaskBook is a desktop application for managing your contact and tasks.** While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using TaskBook, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TaskBook, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.


**Acknowledgements**

* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 (AB-3) project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* The use of SortedList in ModelManager was inspired by [Harmonia](https://github.com/AY2122S2-CS2103T-T09-1/tp), a project also based on AddressBook-Level3.
* The saving and storing of TaskBook in StorageManager was adapted from AddressBook-Level3 to include support for Tasks.
* Libraries used: [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/), [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson), [JUnit5](https://github.com/junit-team/junit5)
