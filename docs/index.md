GithubContact is an address book **integrated with Github's Public API**, targeted at software engineering project
managers to help them communicate and collaborate with their teams smoothly. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using GithubContact, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#getting-started).
* If you are interested about developing GithubContact, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
