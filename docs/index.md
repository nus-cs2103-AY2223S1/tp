**TutHub** is a desktop app for NUS professors who wish to find a new batch of the best teaching assistants from hundreds of tutor profiles by monitoring their performance and track records but have little time to spare for tedious administrative work. While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using Tuthub, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing Tuthub, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
