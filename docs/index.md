BookFace replaces a paper-based system or manual tracking of books, providing greater speed/efficiency in managing and accessing book and user records. While it has a GUI, most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using BookFace, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing BookFace, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
