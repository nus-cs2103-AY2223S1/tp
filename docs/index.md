**UniNurse** is a desktop app tailored for you, a **private duty nurse**, to:
* Manage your patients' contact details.
* Organize your patient-related tasks.
* Keep track of your patients' medical conditions.

While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using UniNurse, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing UniNurse, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
