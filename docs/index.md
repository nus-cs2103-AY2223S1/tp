**JeeqTracker is a desktop application created for home-based business owners / resellers that helps them manage the clients
that they interact with by keeping track of their `BUY / SELL` transactions, and `REMARKS` of clients.**
While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using JeeqTracker, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.md#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing JeeqTracker, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.md) is a good place to start.
