**TrackO is a desktop application that helps you manage your business orders and inventory.** While it has a GUI 
(Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using TrackO, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing TrackO, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
