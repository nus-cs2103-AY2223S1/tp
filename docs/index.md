**bobaBot is a desktop application _designed for bubble tea shop cashiers_ to manage customersâ€™ membership details.** While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

* If you are interested in using bobaBot, head over to the [_Quick Start_ section of the **User Guide**](UserGuide.html#quick-start).
* If you are interested about developing bobaBot, the [**Developer Guide**](DeveloperGuide.html) is a good place to start.
