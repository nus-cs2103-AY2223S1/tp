Welcome to the User Guide for TruthTable!

If you're a student team leader for a software engineering project, and you're struggling to keep track of your team's 
tasks, links, and overall progress, you've come to the right place!

## About TruthTable
TruthTable is a desktop application that enables **student team leaders** to manage their **software engineering 
teams**, including **tasks, links and team members' information** - all in a single application!

TruthTable is **optimized for use via a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#command-line-interface)** while still having the
benefits of a [Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#graphical-user-interface). 
This means that if you can type fast, TruthTable can get your
task and team management done _blazingly fast_, faster than traditional GUI applications.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">**:information_source: Unsure what CLI or GUI means?**
Head over to [this section](#understanding-truthtables-cli) to learn more!
</div>

This guide will help you understand how the various features of TruthTable can help you manage your teams more 
efficiently.

Feel free to read on, or if you can't wait to get started, skip ahead to our [Getting Started Guide](#getting-started) 
to start using TruthTable now!

## Key Features of TruthTable

### Organize All Your Information In One Place

We understand that managing project documents and information is a difficult task. Aside from the large number of links 
and slides created by your team, you may be using task management applications like
<a href="https://www.notion.so/" target="_blank">Notion</a> to track your team's progress as well. 

This is why TruthTable allows you to collate and organize your **tasks, links, and team members' information** in a 
single application!

### Track Progress And Delegate Work

We know that it is often difficult to visualize and communicate your team's progress to various stakeholders 
(e.g. professors, tutors, etc.). 

Well, you never have to worry about tracking your team's progress anymore! Using TruthTable, you can see the 
**number of tasks completed by your team** as well as **which members have been assigned to which tasks** - all in 
one glance!

This can also help you to delegate future tasks more fairly, by considering the workload of all your members.

### Convenient And Fast

We all know that context switching is a productivity killer.

Having to switch back and forth between project management and coding usually means switching between 
[GUI](#graphical-user-interface)-based applications (for project management) [CLI](#command-line-interface) code editors 
(for coding). 

To solve this issue, TruthTable allows you to use a **single CLI for all your project management needs**, reducing 
the impact of context switching. You never have to use a mouse again!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
**:star: For experienced CLI users**:
<br><br>
TruthTable's command syntax is actually very similar to other command line applications like
[Git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/commandline/cli/)!

So, fret not, you will become familiar with TruthTable's commands in no time.

Congratulations! You've successfully understood the entire TruthTable [User Interface](#user-interface)! Continue 
reading on to find out more about how TruthTable makes use of a [Command Line Interface](#command-line-interface).

## Understanding TruthTable's CLI

[Command Line Interface (CLI)](#command-line-interface) applications like TruthTable requires you to type specific words 
(called [commands](#command)) to make use of the application's features. On the other hand,
[Graphical User Interface (GUI)](#graphical-user-interface) programs usually require you to use a mouse to click on 
the screen and perform certain actions.

If you are not an experienced CLI user, terms like "commands", "flags", and "parameters" may appear daunting.

But fret not! This section will cover what all these terms actually mean. By the end of it, you'll be able to 
confidently explain it to your friends too!

### Commands, flags, and parameters

All instructions in TruthTable are executed through **[commands](#command)**. Each command can have **[flags](#flag) 
specified after the command**, which modifies how the instruction should be carried out.

For each of these flags, there may be **[parameters](#parameter)** specified after it. But, **not all commands
require parameters**.

Note that flags and parameters always come **after** the command.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">**:information_source: Do I need to memorize all these commands, 
parameters, and flags?**
Nope!
<br><br>
While you're going through this section, don't worry too much about memorizing the details of every command, as they all
have their own help messages that you can refer to at any time.
<br><br>
Also, the commands in TruthTable are designed to be **easy to remember** and **intuitive**, so you will get familiar
with them in no time!
</div>

Let's use an example to break down what we've talked about.

#### Example Command: `add person`

![CLI Syntax](images/CliSyntax.png)

Here's a summary of what each highlighted section represents.

| Number                                       | Name                                                          | Meaning                                                                                                                           |
|----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| <span class="text-with-color red">1</span>   | <span class="text-with-color red">Command</span>              | <span class="text-with-color red">The name of an instruction</span>                                                               |
| <span class="text-with-color blue">2</span>  | <span class="text-with-color blue">Flag/Option</span>         | <span class="text-with-color blue">Text that is used to modify the operation of a command, often starting with `-` or `--`</span> |
| <span class="text-with-color green">3</span> | <span class="text-with-color green">Parameter/Argument</span> | <span class="text-with-color green">Information specified for a command to operate, often used after flags</span>                 |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
**:information_source: Important note for flags**

- Specifying an "equal" sign (`=`) after the flag is optional, and it has no effect on the command.
- Optional flags are wrapped with square brackets (`[]`)
- Flags can be specified in any order
    - For e.g. `-n name -p 98765432` is the same as `-p 98765432 -n name`

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
**:information_source: Important note for parameters**

Use of quotation marks around parameters (`""` and `''`) is optional.
<br><br>
**However**, if you are specifying a parameter with multiple words, you will need to wrap the words in quotes.
Otherwise, TruthTable will not carry out the command properly.

For instance,

- `add person -n "full name" ...` will recognize "full name" as the name being specified for the new person
- `add person -n full name ...` will recognize "full" as the name being specified for the new person, however, this
  command will not execute successfully as `name` will be treated as a **flag** (and this flag does not exist for
  the `add person` command)

Also, if your quotes are not closed properly (i.e. some open quotation mark does not have a corresponding close
quotation mark), the command will not be executed. If the parameter specified contains quotation marks, they will be
rejected as well.

For instance,

- `'word` is invalid as the open quotation mark `'` does not have a corresponding close quotation mark.
- `"'"` is invalid as `'` will be passed as a parameter, which is invalid.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">
**:bulb: Flags with multiple parameters**
If a flag is displayed with `...` behind it, this means that the flag accepts more than 1 parameter.
<br><br>
For instance, in the `assign task` command, we can specify more than 1 assignee (provided they are valid).
A valid command is `assign task 1 -a 1 2 3` where `1 2 3` are recognized as the assignees to the task with index `1`.
</div>

### Understanding the help message

While using TruthTable, you might have entered the command in an incorrect format - perhaps you forgot to specify a 
flag or a parameter. Will the application crash? Will all your precious data be lost? Absolutely not! 

Rather, we understand that it is possible for anyone to forget the correct format or command name, and we want to help 
you as much as possible! This is why **every command in TruthTable has its own help message**.

Each command allows you to specify the `-h` or `--help` flag, which will show you all the available flags and 
parameters for the command. Alternatively, you can also refer to this user guide to find out the details of any command.

So, you never have to worry about typing a wrong command since there's always help available _at your fingertips_.

Let's dive a little deeper into what a help message looks like and how to interpret it. 

#### Example Command Help Message: `assign task --help`

![Command Help Message](images/CommandHelpMessage.png)

### Aliases

To help you use our program even faster, we have introduced short forms for our commands and flags!

We call these short forms "aliases", and they allow you to execute instructions _blazingly fast_ by minimizing
the number of characters you need to type.

For instance, the [`add person`](#creating-a-new-person-add-person) command has the following command aliases,

- `add p`
- `a person`
- `a p`

The `add person` command also has the following flags and their corresponding aliases,

- aliases for `-h`: `--help`
- aliases for `-e`: `--email`
- aliases for `-n`: `--name`
- aliases for `-p`: `--phone`
- aliases for `-t`: `--tags`

You can find out more about these flags [here](#creating-a-new-person-add-person).

Feel free head over to the [command summary section](#command-aliases)
to find out more about each command and its corresponding aliases.

### Commands to Manage Persons

If you're looking for a quick summary of the commands to manage persons, you can find 
it [here](#summary-of-person-commands).

If you want to understand how each command can be used, we have provided some examples and illustrations on how to use
them, so continue reading on!

#### Creating a new person: `add person`

It's the start of a new semester, and you are excited to work with your new classmates on software engineering 
projects. You meet a person that seems like a really fun person to work with, and you can't wait to know more about 
them. After getting their name, email, and phone number, you can save their contact details on TruthTable with this 
`add person` command! Now you can contact them easily when you are forming your project teams. You may optionally 
specify some tags for any interesting qualities about the person!

This `add person` command allows you to add a new person to TruthTable. The new person is added to the 
[persons section](#persons-section). 

Here, let us take walk through an example on how to add a person.

Let's try to add a new person called John Doe to our application. 

We can do so by entering the command `add person -n "John Doe" -p 98765432 -e johnd@example.com`.

If done successfully, you should see a new person show up in the [persons section](#persons-section) as seen below.

![Add Person Example](images/AddPersonExample.png)

**Format:** `add person [-h] -e=<EMAIL> -n=<NAME> -p=<PHONE> [-t[=<TAGS>...]]...`

| Flags           | Required           | Remarks                                                                |

  with phone number "12345678" and tags "designer" and "friend".

#### Editing a person: `edit person`

Oops! Seems like another classmate, Alex Yeoh, might have provided his school email instead of his personal email. You 
can edit their contact details easily with `edit person`! 

The `edit person` command allows you to edit an existing person in TruthTable. The edited person's details will be 
shown in the [persons section](#persons-section). As always, don't panic if you see an 
error message. Let us run through an example on how to edit the details of a person.

Suppose your classmate, Alex Yeoh, has provided you with the wrong phone and email. Identify the index of
"Alex Yeoh" in the application (1 in the image below). If you are not able to find their name, refer to
[find person command](#finding-a-person-find-person) on how you can find them.

Then, enter the command `edit person 1 -p 91234567 -e johndoe@example.com`.

If done successfully, you should see the new details show up in the [persons section](#persons-section)
under "Alex Yeoh" as seen below.

#### Assign a task to team member: `assign task`

You have tasks that you need to assign people to work on. You can do this  
using the `assign task` command. 

The `assign task` command allows you to assign tasks to members in your team.
The task with the new assignees will be shown in the task list of the [current team section](#current-team-section).

Let us run through an example on how to assign tasks to your team members.

Suppose you have task called "User Stories", and you want to assign it to Alex Yeoh.

Identify the index of "User Stories" in the application (1 in the image below). If you are not able to find the 
task, refer to the [find task command](#finding-a-task-find-task).

Next, identify the index of "Alex Yeoh" in the application (1 in the image below). If you are not able to find the 
member, refer to the [find member command](#finding-a-member-find-member).

Then, enter the command `assign task 1 -a 1`.

If done successfully, you should see the "User Stories" task being assigned to "Alex Yeoh" show up in the task list
of the [current team section](#current-team-section) as shown below. You can also specify multiple members to assign
a task to multiple team members.

![Assign Task Example](images/AssignTaskExample.png)

**Format:** `assign task [-h] -a[=<TASK_ASSIGNEES>...] [-a[=<TASK_ASSIGNEES>...]]... <TASK_INDEX>`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-success">**:bulb: Note**:

The format for the `-a` flag indicates that you must specify at least 1 `-a` flag in your command,

- the first instance of `-a` indicates that you must specify the `-a` flag, and
- the second instance of `-a` indicates that you can specify 0 or more `-a` flags.
  <br>
  This results in requiring at least 1 `-a` flag.

</div>

| Flags              | Required           | Remarks                                                                |
|--------------------|--------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-h`, `--help`     | :x:                | Shows [help message](#understanding-the-help-message) for this command |
| `-a`, `--assignee` | :heavy_check_mark: | Index of members in [members section](#current-team-section)           |

Please take note that:

* `TASK_INDEX` and `TASK_ASSIGNEES` **must be positive integers:** 1, 2, 3,...
* The original assignees of the task will not be replaced with this command. Instead, only new assignees can be added.
* To remove assignees from a task, you can use the [`edit task` command](#edit-task-in-team-edit-task)

**Command Aliases:**

- `assign ta`
- `as task`
- `as ta`

**Examples:**

- `assign task 1 -a` will not do anything.
- `assign task 1 -a 1` will assign the first task on the task list to the first member in the team.
- `assign task 2 -a 1 2` will assign the second task on the task list to the first and second member in the team.

#### Assign a task to random team member: `assign random`

You have tasks and are looking to assign them to different people to work on. Since everyone is capable of 
doing all the tasks, you are not sure whom to assign the tasks to. You can assign tasks to people randomly using 
the `assign random` command. 

The `assign random` command allows you to assign tasks randomly to members in your team. The task with the new
assignees will be shown in the task list of the [current team section](#current-team-section). Let us run through an
example on how to assign tasks randomly to your team members.

Suppose you have task called "Developer Guide", and you want to assign it randomly to your team members.

Identify the index of "Developer Guide" in the application (1 in the image below). If you are not able to find the task, 
refer to the [find task command](#finding-a-task-find-task) on how you can find your task easily.

Then, enter the command `assign random 1`.

If done successfully, you should see the "Developer Guide" task being assigned to a random member. It should show up  
in the task list of the [current team section](#current-team-section) as shown below.

#### Filter tasks by team member: `tasksof`

Your team member privately tells you that he has been assigned too many tasks in this team project. Fortunately, you can
see how many tasks each team member is assigned in your teams with `tasksof` command.

The `tasksof` command allows you to view the specific tasks assigned to a specified member. The tasks that are assigned
to that member will be shown in the task list of the [current team section](#current-team-section).

Let us run through an example on how to assign tasks to your team members.

Suppose you want to check the tasks being assigned to "Alex Yeoh".

Firstly, identify the index of "Alex Yeoh" in the application (1 in the image below). If you are not able to 
find the member, refer to [find member command](#finding-a-member-find-member) on how you can find that member
easily.

Then, enter the command `tasksof 1`.

If done successfully, you should see the all the tasks that "Alex Yeoh" is assigned to. It should show up 
in the task list of the [current team section](#current-team-section) as shown below.

#### List tasks in team: `list tasks`

The final deadline is approaching, and you want to view all the tasks for your team. You can use the 
`list tasks` command to see a list of all your tasks in your team.

The `list tasks` command shows a list of all tasks in your team. After running the 
[find task command](#finding-a-task-find-task), you may wish to view all tasks again.

To do so, enter `list tasks`. 

If done successfully, you should the see all tasks show up in the member list in the
[current team section](#current-team-section) as shown below. You can also view all incomplete and complete tasks by

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous TruthTable home folder.

**Q**: Do I need to save my data manually?<br>
**A**: No. TruthTable saves your data for you automatically after running any command that changes data. For more information, 
you can head to the [saving your data](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#saving-the-data) section.

**Q**: Do I need to be connected to the internet to use TruthTable?<br>
**A**: No, you do not need to be connected to the internet to use our application. However, to open the 
[team links](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#commands-to-manage-links--urls) saved on TruthTable
on your browser, you might need to be connected to the internet for the webpage to load.

**Q**: Why is the list empty when I use the feature `list members`?<br>
**A**: It is likely that you have not added the relevant contacts as members onto your current team. You can add your
members into the team using the [`add member`](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#adding-a-new-member-to-the-team-add-member) command.

**Q**: Why am I seeing `You must have at least one team!` when trying to delete a team?<br>
**A**: You can only delete a team if you have more than one team created. You can use the `add team` command to add a new team
before deleting the team that you wish to delete.

**Q**: Why am I unable to use a command?<br>
**A**: Don't panic! Head to the [Command Summary](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w13-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#command-summary) section to
make sure that you are using the correct command formats.
