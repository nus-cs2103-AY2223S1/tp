## **About Swift+**

Swift+ is a **project management app** designed to help software engineering (SWE) project leads in tracking their daily
interactions with contacts. As a project lead, you can easily **record down your clients and teammates** by creating and editing
contacts using Swift+. Using Swift+â€™s **task management system**, you can assign tasks to contacts and mark tasks as completed.
Finally, you can gain an overview of your project with our intuitive side-by-side user interface.

Perfect for SWE professionals, Swift+ is built around a **command line interface**, complete with an **autocomplete** feature.
If you have fast fingers, Swift+ can help you manage contacts and tasks more quickly than a traditional point-and-click interface.

This user guide provides details on how to use Swift+ in your daily workflow. This guide covers how to set up Swift+ and
use its text-based commands. Get started now by heading over to the [How to use this user guide](#how-to-use-this-user-guide) section!

## **Getting Started**

This section covers how to install and start using Swift+.

### Installation

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html) installed in your computer.

2. Download the latest release of `swift+.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to an empty folder. This will be your home folder for Swift+.

4. Double-click on the jar file to launch Swift+.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up Swift+.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip** <br>
The app comes with sample contacts and tasks by default. To delete the sample data quickly, you can use the [`clear`](#clearing-all-data-clear) command.
</div>

### Layout

After you open Swift+, the app will appear in the form of a graphical user interface, or GUI. In Swift+, you can toggle
between the [Contact View](#contact-view) and the [Task View](#task-view).
Let's take a look at the different components in Swift+ below.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip** <br>
To toggle between Contact View and Task View, you can use the [`Ctrl + Tab`](#toggling-between-contacts-and-tasks-tabs-ctrl--tab) command.
</div>

**Swift+'s GUI:**
![Ui](images/Ui.png)

This table showcases the components shared by both Contact View and Task View.

| Component Name        | Image                                                                      |
| --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Menu Bar**          | ![Menu Bar](images/user-guide/menu-bar.png)                                |

#### Contact View

The contact view is primarily for viewing contacts. The main panel on the left shows a list of contacts and all of their contact information. The right sidebar contains tasks with essential details.

| Component Name   | Image                                                                |

### How to use Swift+ commands

Swift+ is built around text-based commands. Before we dive deeper into the details in the [Commands](#commands) section,
let's learn the basic components and format of a command.

#### Flag

A flag is a delimiter that allows Swift+ to distinguish different input fields. For each flag, you would put in the
corresponding parameter immediately after.

| Flag  | Corresponding Parameter |
| ----- | ----------------------- |
| `a/`  | `ADDRESS`               |
| `c/`  | `CONTACT_INDEX`         |
| `d/`  | `DESCRIPTION`           |
| `dl/` | `DEADLINE`              |
| `e/`  | `EMAIL`                 |
| `n/`  | `NAME`                  |
| `p/`  | `PHONE_NUMBER`          |
| `t/`  | `TAG`, `TASK_INDEX`     |

#### Parameter

A parameter represents placeholders where you input data. Usually, parameters follow immediately after their corresponding flag.

Each parameter has unique constraints, which restricts what you can type in for the parameter. Refer to the table below for details.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note**<br>
Some parameters, such as `CONTACT_INDEX` and `KEYWORD`, may not follow after flags.
</div>

Refer to the [Command Format](#command-format) section on how to use flags and parameters together.

#### Command Format

To understand how a full command is interpreted, let's look at the following example.

**Example:** `add_contact n/CONTACT_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹`

|                    | Component Name | Meaning                                                            |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **`add_contact`**  | Command Word   | Tells Swift+ to execute command to add contact.                    |
| **`n/`**           | Flag           | Distinguishes `CONTACT_NAME` from other input fields.              |
| **`CONTACT_NAME`** | Parameter      | Represents placeholder for name of contact that you wish to input. |

Notice how `t/TAG` is wrapped in `[ ]`. Items in square brackets are **optional**.

- For example, `n/CONTACT_NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Mark t/friend` or as `n/Mark`.

Furthermore, notice how `[t/TAG]` is followed by `â€¦`â€‹. Items followed by `â€¦`â€‹ can be inputted **multiple times**, including
zero times.

- For example, `n/CONTACT_NAME [t/TAG]â€¦â€‹` can be used as `n/Mark` (i.e. 0 times), `n/Mark t/friend`, `n/Mark t/friend t/family`, and etc.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note**<br>

- Parameters can be in **any order**.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/CONTACT_NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/CONTACT_NAME` is also acceptable.
- If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the **last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/1234 p/5678`, only `p/5678` will be taken.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list_contact`, `exit` and `clear`) will be **ignored**.<br>
  e.g. if your specify `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Command suggestion and autocomplete

To help you familiarize with the commands, Swift+ prompts you with command suggestions as you type and can autocomplete your commands until the next user-required input.

1. Type the first few letters of a command you hope to use and Swift+ will display a suggested command. e.g. `lis`.<br>

2. Press `Tab` to autocomplete your command with the prompted suggestion.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note** <br>
- If multiple commands are possible with the current input, autocomplete only completes up to the **longest matching prefix**. e.g. pressing `Tab` after `lis` will autocomplete the command to `list_`, since there are two commands (`list_contact` and `list_task`) that start with `lis`.
- If the current input is invalid, command suggestions will not be shown. The current input will also turn red to alert you.<br>
- Autocomplete does not guarantee a valid command, unless the given syntax is followed.<br>
</div>

### Saving the data

Swift+ data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

### Editing the data file

Swift+ data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:warning: **Caution** <br>
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, Swift+ will discard all data and start with an empty data file in the next run.
</div>

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install Swift+ in the other computer. Replace the default data file `addressbook.json` with the file that contains the data of your previous Swift+.

**Q**: Why does autocomplete not complete the whole suggestion after pressing Tab?<br>
**A**: If multiple commands are possible with the current input, autocomplete only completes up to the **longest matching prefix**. e.g. pressing `Tab` after `lis` will autocomplete the command to `list_`, since there are two commands (`list_contact` and `list_task`) that start with `lis`.
