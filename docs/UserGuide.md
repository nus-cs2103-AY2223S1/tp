subtitle: Explore our guide to use Arrow
---

Welcome to **Arrow** User Guide! This user guide will give you a descriptive instruction on how to use **Arrow**.
The _words_ _in_ _italic_ are terms you may be unfamiliar with. And if that is the case, do not hesitate to check them out in [Glossary](#glossary).

**Arrow** is a **desktop app** that **help software project managers keep track of their members’ tasks and deliverables**. By associating tasks to specific teammates, users can **keep track of what needs to be done and have quick access to contact information should they wish to reach out to the teammate**. More specifically, apart from the _command box_, there are two main lists which store the tasks list and the teammates list. In this way, our users can use two lists to organize the team project easily.

**Arrow** uses a _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) and at the same time possesses the convenience of a _Graphical User Interface_ (GUI). The main target users are software project managers, who should be equipped with _Command Line Interface_ (CLI) skills. And if you can type fast, **Arrow** can help you manage your tasks in an exceptionally quick way.

### Note

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: If you are unfamiliar with Command Line Interface (CLI):**<br>

**Arrow** has the target audiences of software project managers.
In this circumstance, we assume users having some experience of using the command line.<br>
However, it's perfectly fine if you do not know how to use CLI.<br>

## Features

If you are new to **Arrow**, here provides some tips for you to enter commands efficiently.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* The task list shows only **INCOMPLETE** tasks. 
Once a task has been marked (either by the command or by ticking the white box), 
it will be completed and disappears from the task panel as it is NOT incomplete.

* To view the task list with both complete and incomplete ones, using `task list -a`.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* _Extraneous parameters_ for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* `INDEX` must a positive integer of the given item in the panel.

## Task Management Commands

A team Leader in `Arrow` may have tasks to complete or assign to Teammates.

In the Task panel, all tasks are shown coupled with who it has been assigned to.

![Task](images/TaskDetails.png)

A Task has the ability to store these details:
* `Index`: The index of the task in the Tasks panel
* `Title`: Description of the task
* `Deadline`: Deadline given to the Task
* `Project`: Project of the task
* `Assigned Teammates`: Teammates who have been assigned

>:information_source: All task-related commands have the keyword `task` in front of them.
These commands modify the Task panel of `Arrow`.


### Adding a new Task: `task add`

Adds a new task to the task panel.

Format: `task add TITLE`

* `TITLE` refers to the task and **cannot be empty**.
* Tasks with the same `TITLE` cannot be added and will result in an error message.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If the current task list only shows completed task (via `task list -c`), the newly added task will not show up in the list. You can view it by running the command `task list` to show incomplete tasks or `task list -a` to show all tasks.
</div>

Examples:
* `task add Task 1`
* `task add Finish GUI`


---
### Assigning a Task to a Teammate: `task assign`

Assigns or unassigns the specified teammate from address book to a task from task panel.

Format: `task assign TASK_INDEX [+@TEAMMATE_INDEX]…​ [+@TEAMMATE_NAME]…​ [-@TEAMMATE_INDEX]…​ [-@TEAMMATE_NAME]…​`
* +@: Assigns the teammates at the specified TEAMMATE_INDEXs, or with the TEAMMATE_NAME, from `address book` to task at the specified TASK_INDEX from `task list`.
* -@: Unassigns the teammates at the specified TEAMMATE_INDEXs, or with the TEAMMATE_NAME, from `address book` from task at the specified TASK_INDEX from `task list`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A task can have 0 or more assigned teammates.
</div>

Examples:
* `task assign 1 +@1 +@Alex Yeoh -@Bernice Yu` assigns the 1st teammate and "Alex Yeoh" from the address book to the 1st task from task list, and unassigns "Bernice Yu" from the same task.


---
### Marking a Task: `task mark`

Marks a task as complete.

Format: `task mark TASK_INDEX`
* Marks the task at the specified `TASK_INDEX` as complete.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `task list` followed by `task mark 1` marks the 1st task in the task list as complete.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Marking a complete task will not unmark the task.
</div>


---
### Unmarking a Task: `task unmark`

Unmarks a task and sets it as incomplete.

Note;
* To unmark a task, we need to show the full list of tasks with the completed (disappeared) tasks.
* By executing `task list -a` command, we can fully display the task panel with both complete and incomplete tasks.
* Thus we can `unmark` a task from complete to incomplete.

Format: `task unmark TASK_INDEX`
* Show the full task lists by using `task list -a`.
* Unmarks the task at the specified `TASK_INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `task list -a` followed by `task unmark 1` unmarks the 1st task in the task list and sets it as incomplete.


---
### Deleting a Task: `task delete`

Deletes the specified task from the task panel.

Format: `task delete TASK_INDEX`

* Deletes the task at the specified `TASK_INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `task list` followed by `task delete 2` deletes the 2nd task in the task panel.


---
### Setting deadlines to a Task: `task do ... by/`

You can use the `task do ... by/` command to set (or remove) a deadline for some task.

Format: `task do TASK_INDEX by/DATE...`
- The `task do` command sets the deadline specified by `DATE` to the task at the specified `TASK_INDEX` from the task list.
- You can only use plain English to describe the intended deadline, such as `today`, `tomorrow`, `next Thursday`, `14 November 2022`, and so on.
- Dates containing non-alphanumeric characters such as `11-11-2022` will not be accepted and an error message will be thrown.
- If the application is unable to determine a date from your input, an error message will be displayed, and you will be prompted to try a different input.
- To **remove** the deadline from a task, you can use the special character `?`.

##### Examples:
* `task do 1 by/tomorrow` sets the deadline for the 1st task in the list to tomorrow.
* `task do 1 by/?` **removes** the deadline from the 1st task in the list.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Additional Notes:**<br>
* As we foresee that most of your tasks should fall within the current year, the deadline of such tasks have their year omitted in the task panel.<br>
* You may refer to the screenshot below for a better understanding
</div>

![Task Deadline](images/deadline-ui.png)


---
### Sorting tasks by deadline: `task sort`

Sorts the task list by deadline. Tasks with earlier deadlines will be put at the top, while tasks without any deadlines will be at the bottom.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Additional Notes:**<br>
* After this command is run, the task panel will only show incomplete tasks. 
<br>
</div>

Format: `task sort`


---
### Filtering the Tasks List: `task list`

The `task list` command is a powerful command that allows you to focus only on the tasks that matter to you.

Format: `task list [KEYWORD] [#PROJECT_NAME]... [@TEAMMATE_INDEX]... [before/DATE] [after/DATE] [-a] [-c]`

The format above may look daunting, but this is only because the `task list` command allows you to potentially describe complex queries.

However, all the parameters are optional, and in most cases, you will only need a simple query that uses just one or two parameters.

For ease of understanding, many of these common use cases have been detailed below.


#### 1. Filtering by Completion Status

`Format: task list [-a] [-c]`
- The simplest form of the command is simply `task list`. This allows you to view all incomplete tasks.
- You may find this command useful to reset your task list back to its default state.

##### Examples
- `task list -a` returns **all** tasks, regardless of completion status.
- `task list -c` returns all **completed** tasks only.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Additional Notes:**<br>
* When the `-a` or `-c` parameters are not specified, the `task list` command returns all **incomplete** tasks that match the given query.<br>
* In the following examples, 'all tasks' will refer to 'all incomplete tasks' for brevity.<br>
</div>

#### 2. Filtering by Description
`Format: task list KEYWORD`
- The `KEYWORD` parameter allows you to search for tasks that contain `KEYWORD`.

##### Example
- `task list fix` returns all tasks whose description contains the keyword `fix`.

#### 3. Filtering by Project
`Format: task list #PROJECT_NAME...`
- The `#` parameter allows you to search for tasks that are assigned to **any** of the project(s) you specify.

##### Example
- `task list #CS2101 #CS2103T` returns all tasks that are **either** under the project `CS2101` **or** `CS2103T`.

#### 4. Filtering by Assigned Contact(s)
`Format: task list @TEAMMATE_INDEX...`
- The `@` parameter allows you to search for tasks that are assigned to **all** the contact(s) you specify.
- Shows the tasks of the specified `TEAMMATE_INDEX`.
- The contact refers to the index number shown in the displayed teammate list.
- The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

##### Example
- `task list @1 @2` returns all tasks that are assigned to **both** the 1st and 2nd teammates from the address book.

#### 5. Filtering by Deadline
Format: `task list before/DATE after/DATE`
- The `before/` and `after/` parameters allow you to specify a date range to filter the tasks by, according to their deadline.
- - Tasks with unspecified deadlines will be displayed regardless of the filters.
- You can choose to use only one of the parameters, as shown in the examples below.

##### Examples
- `task list before/ next Monday after/ tomorrow` returns all tasks whose deadline is after tomorrow but before next Monday.
- `task list before/ end of the month` returns all tasks whose deadline is before the end of the month.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
**:bulb: Tips for Advanced Users:**<br>
* You can use any combination of the parameters above to build a query that matches your unique requirements!<br>
* Do note that the `KEYWORD` parameter **must** come first, if any other parameters are used.<br>
</div>


---
### Editing a task: `task edit`

Edits an existing task in the task list.

Format: `task edit TASK_INDEX [ti/TITLE] [by/DEADLINE] [#/PROJECT]`

* Edits the task at the specified `TASK_INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields (`TITLE`, `DEADLINE`, `PROJECT`) must be provided. If none are provided, the application will give an error.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.


---
### Listing all projects: `task project`

Lists all the projects present in the task panel.<br>
Projects of hidden tasks will also be shown.

>:information_source: The only way to add a project is to use the `task edit` command.
> The task panel will not be changed to show only tasks with project.

Format: `task project`


---
### Saving the data

Arrow data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

Arrow data are saved as JSON files, one for AddressBook (Teammates) and one for TaskPanel (Tasks).
* AddressBook: `[JAR file location]/data/addressbook.json`
* TaskPanel: `[JAR file location]/data/taskpanel.json`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Data file should not be edited manually!
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Proposed Features

Features to implement in the coming versions.

### Sort Teammates by name
Sort Teammates by alphabetical order of their names. Currently, it is difficult to search for specific Teammates if the list becomes too long. This feature would allow easier finding of Teammates as there is an order in the list of Teammates.

### Recurring Tasks
Extensive project management is planned for future iterations, to allow for better planning. This will also add the ability to
add tasks of the same name (different projects) since categorisation will be done by projects instead.

## Tutorial for CLI

A command-line interface (CLI) is a text-based user interface (UI) used to run programs, 
manage computer files and interact with the computer.

[This article](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/command-line-commands-cli-tutorial/) showed you several “unknown-to-many” commands 
you can use to get access to hidden functionalities on your personal computer.

### Some of our features
To improve the speed of your actions and quality of your life while using the application we have also implemented the below features
* When your command box is out of focus and empty, you can press the `/` key on your command to immediately put your cursor on the command box.
  ![command box out of focus](images/CommandBoxFocus.png)
  The command box will be focused and appears as below. A slash will appear and you will have to delete it before entering the next command.
  ![command box set focused](images/CommandBoxSetFocused.png)
* When you enter a command, it disappears from the command box is run by the application. You may use the `UP` arrow key to go back to a previous command or `DOWN` arrow key to go to the next command. However, if there is text entered, then you cannot use this feature.

## Behind Everything

### Why we are using two different lists?

* **Task Panel List**

As software project team leaders, it is important to have a clear vision of tasks to be implemented,
since there could be many projects and each project may have so many items to keep in track.
Thus, **Arrow** has a task panel list to keep every task organized. 
Details of each task can be added, which helps the team managers no fear of leaving out any progress.

    Also, the task panel list only shows the incomplete tasks.


* **Teammate List**

    The most important part of a software project is the team members serving at different positions,
**Arrow** helps tracking details of every team member and links them to their tasks to be finished.
