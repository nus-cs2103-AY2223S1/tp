<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Command format**

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* All flags and options must be specified before any prefix or parameter.

* Flags can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `-p PATIENT_INDEX -t TASK_INDEX`, `-t TASK_INDEX -p PATIENT_INDEX` is also acceptable.

* There must be a space separating a flag and an option.

* All indices ***must be a positive integer*** 1, 2, 3, …

* `PATIENT_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed patient list.

* Indices for patient attributes (e.g. `TASK_INDEX`, `CONDITION_INDEX`, `TAG_INDEX`, etc.) refer to the index number shown in the attribute list of a patient.<br>
  e.g. `TASK_INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the task list of a patient.

* The `|` character is used as a parameter separator in an attribute.
  e.g. in `m/MEDICATION_TYPE | DOSAGE`, the `|` character is used to separate `MEDICATION_TYPE` and `DOSAGE`.

* Parameters in square brackets and angle brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
  e.g. `d/TASK_DESCRIPTION | <DATE TIME> | <INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD>` can be used as `d/task 1` or `d/task 1 | 22-3-22 1800`.

* Parameters with `…` after them can be used multiple times, including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Patient parameter constraints**

A patient's attributes can be categorized into two: *single-valued attributes* and *multi-valued attributes*. A patient's single-valued attributes consist of their name, phone, email, and address, and their multi-valued attributes consist of their tags, tasks, conditions, medications, and remarks.

### Single-valued attributes

A patient's single-valued attributes are also referred to as the patient's contact details, which consist of the following.

#### `n/NAME`

`NAME` should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces. 

`NAME` is specified by the prefix `n/`.

Example: `n/John Doe`

#### `p/PHONE`

`PHONE` should only contain numbers, and it should be at least 3 digits long. 

`PHONE` is specified by the prefix `p/`.

Example: `p/91234567`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### `e/EMAIL`

`EMAIL` should be in the form of `local-part@domain`, where:
* `local-part` contains only alphanumeric characters and the special characters `+`, `_`, `.`, `-`, and may not start or end with any special characters.
* `domain` is made up of domain labels separated by periods, where `domain` must:
  - end with a domain label at least 2 characters long.
  - have each domain label start and end with alphanumeric characters.
  - have each domain label consist of alphanumeric characters, separated only by hyphens, if any.

`EMAIL` is specified by the prefix `e/`.

Example: `johndoe@gmail.com`

#### `a/ADDRESS`

`ADDRESS` accepts any values, excluding prefixes.

`ADDRESS` is specified by the prefix `a/`.

Example:`a/John street, block 123, #01-01`

<br>

[Back to Table of Contents ↑](#table-of-contents)

### Multi-valued attributes

#### `t/TAG`

`TAG` accepts any values, excluding prefixes.

`TAG` is specified by the prefix `t/`, and its index by the flag `-t`.

Example:`t/12-A nursing home`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### `d/TASK_DESCRIPTION | DATE TIME | INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD`

The task parameter has the following constraints:

* `TASK_DESCRIPTION` accepts any values, excluding prefixes and `|` separators.
* `DATE TIME` should be in the format of `DD-MM-YY` or `DD-MM-YY HHMM`. <br>
   e.g. `2-7-22 1345`, `09-4-22`, `08-06-22 0900`, `7-06-22 2130` and `28-10-22` are all valid `DATE TIME`.
* `INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD` should be in the format of `X day(s)/week(s)/month(s)/year(s)` where `X` is a positive integer.

`TASK` is specified by the prefix `d/`, and its index by the flag `-d`.

Example: `d/Take CT scan | 23-11-22 1530 | 2 months`

#### `c/CONDITION`

`CONDITION` accepts any values, excluding prefixes.

`CONDITION` is specified by the prefix `c/`, and its index by the flag `-c`.

Example:`c/Parkinson's disease`

#### `m/MEDICATION_TYPE | DOSAGE`

`MEDICATION_TYPE` accepts any values, excluding prefixes and `|` separators.
`DOSAGE` should only contain alphanumeric characters, decimal points, and spaces.

`MEDICATION` is specified by the prefix `m/`, and its index by the flag `-m`.

Example:`m/Amoxicillin | 0.5g every 8 hours`

#### `r/REMARK`

`REMARK` accepts any values, excluding prefixes.

`REMARK` is specified by the prefix `r/`, and its index by the flag `-r`.

Example:`r/Allergic to peanuts`

### Adding a task: `add` `-p`

You can add a task or recurring task to a patient with the `add` command.

Format: **`add`** `-p PATIENT_INDEX d/TASK_DESCRIPTION | <DATE TIME> | <INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD>`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Notes:**

* `DATE TIME` and `INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD` must follow the criteria defined in [Task parameters](#dtask_description--date-time--interval-time_period).
* If `DATE TIME` is omitted, the task will be created with a date and time 24 hours from the moment of creation.
* If `DATE` is specified but `TIME` is omitted, the task will be created with a default time of `0000` hours.
* If `INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD` is omitted, then the task created will be a non-recurring task, i.e. a one-off task.
* Note that tasks are automatically sorted in chronological order upon being added. <br> 
  e.g. if the patient already has tasks on `24-10-22`, and a new task on `27-10-22` is created, then the new task will be the 2nd task for the patient after the one on `24-10-22`.
* If the day portion of the date exceeded the last day of that calendar month, but is between 1 and 31, it would default to the last day of the month. <br>
  e.g. `31-4-22` will be automatically converted to `30-4-22`, and `30-2-20` will be converted to `29-2-20` (since 2020 is a leap year).
* Overdue recurring tasks will automatically add corresponding new recurring tasks based on their frequency.
* Tasks are considered duplicates only when `TASK_DESCRIPTION`, `DATE TIME`, and `INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD` (if applicable) are the same e.g. `Take X-rays | 23-4-22 1345` is different from `Take X-rays | 23-4-22 1345 | 3 weeks`.
* Tasks are case-sensitive e.g. `Take X-rays` is distinct from `Take x-rays`.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

:exclamation: **Caution:**

If you enter a `TIME` of `2400`, then the date and time will be set to `0000` hours of the next day.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `add -p 1 d/Administer 3ml of example medicine` adds a task to the 1st patient in the patient list.
* `find Betsy` followed by `add -p 2 d/Change dressing on left arm | 12-7-22` adds a task to the 2nd patient in the results of the `find` command, on 12th July 2022 0000 hours.
* `add -p 3 d/Take X-rays | 23-4-22 1345 | 3 weeks` adds a recurring task to the 3rd patient for every 3 weeks starting from 23rd April 2022 1345 hours.

### Editing a task: `edit` `-p` `-d`

You can edit a task of a patient with the `edit` command.

Format: **`edit`** `-p PATIENT_INDEX -d TASK_INDEX d/<TASK_DESCRIPTION> | <DATE TIME> | <INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD>`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Notes:**

* `DATE TIME` and `INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD` must follow the criteria defined in [Task parameters](#patient-parameter-constraints).
* If a `INTERVAL TIME_PERIOD` is provided for what was originally a non-recurring task, the edit will transform it into a recurring one based on the given frequency
* Tasks are automatically sorted in chronological order upon modification, i.e. if a task on `25-10-22` is edited to be `30-10-22`, its new `TASK INDEX` would be based on the displayed order in the patient's task list.
* If there are duplicate tasks after editing a task, it will not be edited.
* You cannot have a `|` at the end or else a warning will be thrown.
</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `edit -p 1 -d 1 d/Administer 3ml of example medicine` edits the description of the 1st task of the 1st patient in the patient list to `Administer 3ml of example medicine`, while retaining the original date and time for the task.
* `find Betsy` followed by `edit -p 2 -d 3 d/| 23-10-22 0800` edits the date and time of the 3rd task of the 2nd patient in the results of the `find` command to 23rd October 2022 0800 hours, while retaining the original description for the task.
* `list` followed by `edit -p 1 -d 1 d/| | 3 days` edits the recurrence of the 1st task of the 1st patient if the task was a recurring task to every 3 days, while keeping the original description, date, and time. If the task was a non-recurring task, then this edit transforms the task into a recurring task with a recurrence of every 3 days.
* `list` followed by `edit -p 2 -d 3 d/| 25-10-22 | 2 weeks` edits the date and recurrence of the 3rd task for the 2nd patient in the patient list to 25th October 2022 and every 2 weeks, while keeping the original description and time. If the task was a non-recurring task, then this edit transforms the task into a recurring task with a recurrence of every 2 weeks.
* `find David` followed by `edit -p 1 -d 2 d/Change bandage | | 4 days` edits the description and recurrence of the 2nd task of the 1st patient in the results of `find` command to `Change bandage` and every 4 days, while keeping the original date and time. If the task was a non-recurring task, then this edit transforms the task into a recurring task with a recurrence of every 4 days.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Notes:**

You must always provide a `DATE` if you want to change the `TIME`. <br>
e.g. to change from `25-10-22 0800` to `25-10-22 0900`, the edit would be `d/| 25-10-22 0900`.
