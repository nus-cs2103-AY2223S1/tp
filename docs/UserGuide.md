## Introduction

**TrackO** is a desktop application built for small home-based business owners (just like you!) to manage their orders 
and inventory items. It is an **integrated solution** that merges the process of tracking orders and inventory in one
place, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface ([CLI](#cli)), while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface
([GUI](#gui)).

If you love to type, **TrackO** can get your order and inventory management tasks done faster than
the traditional solution of pen and paper, and even popular GUI applications such as spreadsheets
(_e.g. Microsoft Excel, Google Sheets, etc._).

Even if you are not _that_ comfortable with typing, fret not! **TrackO** is built with you
in mind. The functionalities are beginner-friendly and extremely easy to pick up.

As a broad overview, **TrackO** provides users with the ability to:
* View and manage inventory data
* View and manage order data
* Ensure consistency between inventory and order data
_(e.g. automatically updating in-stock quantities on marking orders as paid/delivered)_

Currently, **TrackO** only supports tracking inventory items that are countable by units _(e.g. 1 apple, 2 cookies, etc.)_.
Our development team will introduce more powerful inventory tracking functionalities _(e.g. by weight, by litres, etc.)_
in future enhancements of the product (stay tuned!).

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer. To do so, refer to this FAQ [here](#java-installation).

2. Download the latest `TrackO.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your TrackO.

    <img src="./images/user-guide/HomeFolder.png" alt="HomeFolder">

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
        :bulb: **Tip:**
        Any folder can be a home folder for your TrackO. However, it is recommended that you use an **empty folder** as
        your home folder, as the file containing your data will also be stored in this folder. In this case, the home
        folder is an empty folder called `TrackO` located in the `Desktop`.
    </div>

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the one below should appear in a few seconds. The application will already contain some sample
   data.

   <img src="./images/Ui.png" alt="Ui">

5. Head over to the [tutorial](#tutorial) section for a small walkthrough of some of TrackO's commands and use cases.

6. If you'd like to skip the tutorial, head over to the [features](#features) section for some of the more technical
   and in-depth explanation of each command's format a use case.

## Tutorial

To get you started, here are some simple commands you can try out on our sample data before getting to know more of
TrackO's functionalities! 

1. We start off by getting to know how to manage your **inventory**!

   * **Adding an item: `addi`**
       * Suppose you have `350` units of the item `Teddy bear keychain` currently in your physical inventory.
         Each unit costs `$0.89` to produce, and you will be selling them at `$3.50` each.
       * You can add this as an inventory item to TrackO by entering the following command into the [command box](#layout): <br>
         `addi i/Teddy bear keychains q/350 d/Great for kids! t/New sp/3.50 cp/0.89`
       * This command also adds a short description, `Great for kids!` to the item and tags it as `New`.

         You should see this item appear in TrackO at [index](#index) `5` as shown below:
   
         <img src="./images/user-guide/Tutorial1.png" alt="Tutorial1">
    
2. Next, we move on to managing your **orders**!
   * **Adding an order: `addo`**
       * Suppose a customer by the name `Jonathan Chee` wants his order delivered to `43 Clementi Road, 639433`. He is 
        contactable by the email `JonChee@gmail.com` and at the phone number`96785944`. He has also ordered 1 unit of `Teddy bear keychain`.
       * Firstly, initiate the `addo` command with the customer details by entering the following command into the [command box](#layout): <br>
         `addo n/Jonathan Chee p/96785944 e/JonChee@gmail.com a/43 Clementi Road, 639433`
       * Next, to add the items ordered by the customer, enter the following command into the [command box](#layout): <br>
         `i/teddy bear keychains q/1`
       * Finally, enter `done` to finish adding the order to TrackO!
      
         You should see this order appear in TrackO at index `5` as shown below:

         <img src="./images/user-guide/Tutorial2.png" alt="Tutorial2">
    
         <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
         If an item is not in your inventory, TrackO does not allow you to add that item to an order!
         </div>

   * **Finding order(s): `findo`**
      * Our application allows you to search for orders by different fields (e.g. payment status, delivery status, customer details).
      * To find orders to be delivered to `Clementi` which have not been paid for, enter the following command to the [command box](#layout): <br>

        `findo -P a/Clementi`
   
        You should see these orders appear in the [order list](#layout), as shown below:
        
        <img src="./images/user-guide/Tutorial3.png" alt="Tutorial3">
    
   * **Listing order(s): `listo`**
       * To view all your orders again, enter `listo`.
          
         You should see these orders appear in the [order list](#layout), as shown below:
         
         <img src="./images/user-guide/Tutorial4.png" alt="Tutorial4">

Now that you're done trying out some commands, you can enter `exit` to leave the application. We hope that this short tutorial was helpful! 
To check out more commands, you can head over to our [Features](#features) section.

## Command guide

This section of the user guide helps to break down the formatting used for commands in this user guide.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the [parameters](#parameter) to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `addo n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `addo n/John Doe ...`.

* Parameters in square brackets `[]` are optional. <br>
  e.g. in `findo KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`, only the first `KEYWORD` is compulsory. The rest are optional.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `i/ITEM_NAME q/QUANTITY`, `q/QUANTITY i/ITEM_NAME` is also acceptable.

* All command keywords (e.g. `addo`, `marko`, `editi`, etc.), prefixes (e.g. `p/`, `i/`, etc.)
  and flags (e.g. `-p`, `-D`, etc.) are **case-sensitive**, unless stated otherwise.<br/>
  e.g. `addo` is a valid command keyword, but `addO` is invalid. 

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* If you use parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `listi`, `listo`,`clear` and `exit`), these parameters will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `listi 123`, it will be interpreted as `listi`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding an inventory item: `findi`

Finds an inventory item whose name fits any of the given keywords.

Format: `findi KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

- The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `keychain` will match `Keychain`
- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `pants long` will match `long pants`
- Only the name of the item is searched.
- Only full words will be matched. e.g. `key` will not match `Keychain`
- Items matching at least one keyword will be returned.
  e.g. `shirt` will return `dress shirt`, `collared shirt`

Example(s):
- When you enter `findi mattress` to our sample data, TrackO will find items that contain the word `mattress` in their 
  item name and display the following result:

  <img src="./images/user-guide/FindiExample1.png" alt="FindiExample1">
  
- When you enter `findi mattress chair` to our sample data, TrackO will find items that contain the word `mattress` or

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting an inventory item: `deletei`

Deletes the specified item from the list of tracked inventory.

Format: `deletei INDEX`

* Deletes the item at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed inventory list.
* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
TrackO does not allow items that are currently involved with unpaid or undelivered orders to be deleted.
</div>

Example(s):
* When you enter `deletei 1` to our sample data, TrackO deletes the first item, `Chair` from the inventory list. 
  Notice how the order involving `Chair` is completed, which allows the `Chair` to be deleted:

  <img src="./images/user-guide/DeleteiExample1.png" alt="DeleteiExample1">
  
* When you enter `deletei 2` to our sample data, TrackO will remind you that the item you are trying to delete is currently
  involved in an uncompleted order (in this case, the order at index `2`). You will not be able to delete the item until the order is 
  completed. To do so, see [`marko`](#marking-an-order-as-paiddelivered-marko).

  <img src="./images/user-guide/DeleteiExample2.png" alt="DeleteiExample2">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Editing an inventory item: `editi`

Edits an existing item in the inventory list.

Format: `editi INDEX [i/ITEM_NAME] [q/QUANTITY] [d/DESCRIPTION] [sp/SELL_PRICE] [cp/COST_PRICE] [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* Edits the item at the specified `INDEX`.

* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed inventory list.

* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

* You can remove all the item’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
When an `Item` is involved in an uncompleted order, you cannot edit its `Item Name`, `Sell Price`, and `Cost Price`.
You can only edit its `Quantity`, `Description`, `Tag`.
</div>

Example(s):

* When you enter `editi 1 i/Table q/200 d/Metal Table t/Fragile` to our sample data, TrackO will edit the item name, quantity, 
  description and tag of the 1st item, which was `Chair`, to be `Table`, `200`, `Metal Table` and `Fragile` respectively.
  
  <img src="./images/user-guide/EditiExample1.png" alt="EditiExample1">
  
* When you enter `editi 1 t/`, TrackO removes the tags of the item at index `1`.

  <img src="./images/user-guide/EditiExample2.png" alt="EditiExample2">

* When you enter `editi 3 i/Cookies d/Delicious home-made cookies` to our sample data, TrackO will remind you that the item
you are trying to edit is currently involved in an uncompleted order (in this case, the order at index `3`) and the item will not be edited.
  
  <img src="./images/user-guide/EditiExample3.png" alt="EditiExample3">

-------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### <u>Order management</u>

The commands included in this section are related to order management.
As of `v1.4`, there are 7 commands.

[Back to top &#8593;](#welcome-to-trackos-user-guide)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding an order: `addo`

Creates an order to be added to the list of orders tracked by TrackO.

* The added orders will track the time that it was created.

The first step is to initiate the command with the customer's data.

Format: `addo n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS`

Example(s):
* `addo n/John Doe p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com a/48 Westwood Terrace` creates an order for customer `John Doe`, who is contactable at `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` and wants the order delivered to `48 Westwood Terrace`
* `addo n/Betty White p/92345678 e/bettywhite@example.com a/39 Ocean Drive` creates an order for customer `Betty White`, who is contactable at `92345678` and `bettywhite@example.com` and wants the order delivered to `39 Ocean Drive`

The next step is to add the order items and their order quantities to the created order.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can repeat this step until all desired item data has been added to the created order.
</div>

Format: `i/ITEM_NAME q/QUANTITY`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* You must input an item name that matches an existing item in your inventory list.

* The name matching is case-insensitive. <br>
e.g. `i/pEn q/3` and `i/pen q/3` will both add `3` quantities (or units) of the inventory item `Pen` to the 
created order.

* You must input a quantity of integer value more than 0, <br> e.g. `q/1` or `q/3` but NOT `q/0` or `q/-1`.

* If you input an item name that matches previously entered item, the quantity of the added item will be updated instead. <br>
e.g. `i/Box q/3` followed by `i/Box q/4` will only add a total of `4` quantities (or units) of `Box` to the created order


</div>

Lastly, to end the command, you can enter `done` to tell TrackO to track the order or `cancel` to completely abort the command.

Example(s):
- When you enter `addo n/John Doe p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com a/48 Westwood Terrace`, followed by  `i/pillow q/5`,
then lastly `done`, you are creating an order for `John Doe`, who is contactable at `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` 
and wants `5 Pillows` delivered to `48 Westwood Terrace`. Executing this command to our sample data will display the 
following result:

  <img src="./images/user-guide/AddoExample1.png" alt="AddoExample1">

[Back to top &#8593;](#welcome-to-trackos-user-guide)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Listing all orders: `listo`

Lists all the orders a store has.

Format: `listo`

Example(s):
- When you enter `listo` to our sample data, TrackO will list all the existing orders in the [order list](#layout). Executing it 
on our sample data will display the following result:
  
  <img src="./images/user-guide/ListoExample.png" alt="ListoExample">

[Back to top &#8593;](#welcome-to-trackos-user-guide)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding order(s): `findo`

Finds order(s) according to input flags/keywords.

Format: `findo [-d OR -D] [-p OR -P]` <br> 
`[i/ITEM_KEYWORD [MORE_ITEM_KEYWORDS]]` <br> 
`[a/ADDRESS_KEYWORD [MORE_ADDRESS_KEYWORDS]]` <br> 
`[n/NAME_KEYWORD [MORE_NAME_KEYWORDS]]`

* All 4 flags (`-d`, `-D`, `-p`, `-P`) are optional.
  * `-d`: search for orders which are delivered
  * `-D`: search for orders which are not delivered
  * `-p`: search for orders which are paid
  * `-P`: search for orders which are not paid
* There are 3 prefixes (`a/`, `n/`, `i/`). **If there are no flags present**, at least one of the 3 prefixes must be used.
  * `a/`: searches by address
  * `n/`: searches by name
  * `i/`: searches by order item
* A prefix is only expected once in the command but if specified multiple times, only the last occurrence of 
the parameter will be taken in, e.g. `findo a/Clementi a/Geylang` will search for orders with `Geylang` 
in their address.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* The search keywords used are case-insensitive. <br>
  e.g. `keychain` will match `Keychain`

* The order of the keywords does not matter. <br>
  e.g. `findo a/Geylang n/Alex` will also give the same results as `findo n/Alex a/Geylang`

* Only full words will be matched. <br>
  e.g. `Gardens,` will not match `Gardens` and `keychain` will not match `keychains`

* Orders matching at least one keyword will be displayed. <br>
  e.g. `findo i/apple keychain` will display `apple painting` and `banana keychain`

</div>

Example(s):
- When you enter `findo n/Alex a/Geylang`, TrackO will display all orders with the name `Alex` and an address 
including the word `Geylang`. Executing it on our sample data will display the following result:

  <img src="./images/user-guide/FindoExample1.png" alt="FindoExample1">

* When you enter `findo n/Charlotte Bernice a/Serangoon Ang Mo Kio`, TrackO will display all orders with the name 
`Charlotte` or `Bernice` and an address including the word `Serangoon` or `Ang Mo Kio`. Executing it on our sample
data will display the following result:
  
  <img src="./images/user-guide/FindoExample2.png" alt="FindoExample2">

* When you enter `findo -d n/Charlotte`, TrackO displays all orders with the name `Charlotte` which have been marked as `delivered`.
Executing it on our sample data will display the following result:

  <img src="./images/user-guide/FindoExample3.png" alt="FindoExample3">
  
* When you enter `findo -d -p n/Alex` displays all orders with the name `Alex` which have been marked as `paid` and `delivered`.
Executing it on our sample data will display the following result:

    <img src="./images/user-guide/FindoExample4.png" alt="FindoExample4">

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Completed orders are orders which have been paid **and** delivered. You can search using both `-p` **and** `-d` to find completed orders!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sorting orders by time created: `sorto`

Sorts the displayed list of orders by the time at which they were created.

Format: `sorto new` or `sorto old`

* The keywords `new` and `old` are case-insensitive.
* `sorto new` sorts the order list such that the newest orders are at the top.
* `sorto old` sorts the order list such that the oldest orders are at the top.

Example(s):
* When you enter `listo` followed by `sorto old`, TrackO sorts all orders such that oldest orders are at the top.
Executing it on our sample data will display the following result:

  <img src="./images/user-guide/SortoOldExample.png" alt="SortoOldExample">

* For this example, let us follow the steps described below:
  1. First, enter `addo n/Jessica Doe a/Blk 12 Changi Road 20, #01-15 p/90876543 e/jessicadoe@gmail.com`, followed by
     `i/Chair q/5`, then `done` to add an order of `5 Chairs` for customer `Jessica Doe`. The application will display 
     the following result:
  
     <img src="./images/user-guide/SortoNew1-1.png" alt="SortoNewExample1-1">
     
  2. Next, enter `findo i/Chair` to display all the orders that have `Chair` in their list of ordered items. The application
     will display the following result:
  
     <img src="./images/user-guide/SortoNew1-2.png" alt="SortoExample1-2">
    
  3. When you enter `sorto new`, the currently displayed orders will be sorted from the newest to the oldest. The application 
     will display the following result:

     <img src="./images/user-guide/SortoNew1-3.png" alt="SortoExample1-3">

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting an order: `deleteo`

Deletes an order from the list of tracked orders.

Format: `deleteo INDEX`

* Deletes the order at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed order list.
* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …

Example(s):
* When you enter `listo` followed by `deleteo 2`, TrackO deletes the 2nd order from the order list. Executing it on our 
sample data will display this result:

  <img src="./images/user-guide/DeleteoExample1.png" alt="DeleteoExample1">

* For the second example, let us follow the steps described below:
  1. First, enter `findo i/Pillow`. TrackO will display orders with the item `Pillow` in their list of ordered items.

     <img src="./images/user-guide/DeleteoExample2-1.png" alt="DeleteoExample2-1">
     
  2. When you enter `deleteo 1`, TrackO will delete the order currently displayed at index `1`, which is the order with 
     `Pillow` in its list of ordered items. It will display the following result:

     <img src="./images/user-guide/DeleteoExample2-2.png" alt="DeleteoExample2-2">
     
  3. To redisplay all your existing orders, enter `listo` and it should look like the following:

     <img src="./images/user-guide/DeleteoExample2-3.png" alt="DeleteoExample2-3">

* For the third example, let us follow the steps described below:
  1. First, enter `sorto new`. TrackO will sort the orders from the newest to the oldest, with the most recent 
     order at the top.

     <img src="./images/user-guide/DeleteoExample3-1.png" alt="DeleteoExample3-1">
  
  2. When you enter `deleteo 1`, TrackO will delete the order currently displayed at index `1`, i.e. the most recent order.

### Editing an order: `edito`

Edits an existing order in the order list.

Format: `edito INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [i/ITEM_NAME q/QUANTITY]`

* Edits the order at the specified `INDEX`.
* This feature is case-insensitive.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed order list.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* Every field is optional, but if you were to include `i/ITEM_NAME`, you must also include 
  `q/QUANTITY`. Both fields need to be present to update an order's list of ordered items.
* You can only edit an order's list of ordered items to consist of items that exists in your inventory. <br> 
  e.g. If your inventory does not have `Apples`, then you cannot edit any of your order's list of ordered items to `Apples`.
* Editing an item that does not exist in your order's list of ordered items, but exists in your inventory 
  will add the item to the order's list of ordered items. <br> e.g. Your inventory has `Apples` and `Bananas`. Right now, the third order's list of ordered items only has `Apples`.
  `edito 3 i/Bananas q/3` will add `3` `Bananas` to the third order's list of ordered items.
* Setting `q/0` to any item in the order's list of ordered items will remove the item from the list. <br> e.g. The fourth order's list of ordered items has
`2` `Apples` and `3` `Bananas`. Inputting `edito 4 i/Bananas q/0` will remove the `Bananas` from the fourth order's list of ordered items, leaving only
the `2` `Apples`.



<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* Only orders which are not marked as `paid` or `delivered` can be edited.

* The order's created time cannot be edited.

* An order's paid status and delivery status also cannot be edited through this command. To modify those,
  see [`marko`](#marking-an-order-as-paiddelivered-marko) instead.

</div>

Example(s):
* For this example, let us follow the steps described below:
  1. When you enter `edito 2 n/Peter p/98765432 e/peter@email.com a/123 Apartment Unit, #05-11`, TrackO will edit the name, 
     phone, email, and address of the second order in the list to `Peter`,`98765432`, `peter@email.com`, and 
     `123 Apartment Unit, #05-11` respectively. It will display this result when executed on our sample data:

     <img src="./images/user-guide/EditoExample1-1.png" alt="EditoExample1-1">
  
  2. Next, entering `edito 4 i/Chair q/5` will add `5 Chairs` to the fourth order's list of ordered items, as shown below:

     <img src="./images/user-guide/EditoExample1-2.png" alt="EditoExample1-2">
  
  3. Now, let us try entering `edito 4 i/mattress q/0`. Doing this will remove the item `Mattress` from the fourth order's 
     list of ordered items.

     <img src="./images/user-guide/EditoExample1-3.png" alt="EditoExample1-3">
  
  4. Finally, try entering `edito 4 i/Chair q/10`. TrackO will update the quantity of ordered `Chairs` in the fourth order to `10`.

### Marking an order as paid/delivered: `marko`

Marks an existing order in the order list as paid and/or delivered. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">
:exclamation: **Warning:** `marko` is irreversible. This means that you cannot unmark an order that is marked as 
paid and/or delivered. 
</div>

Format: `marko INDEX [-p] [-d]`

* Marks the order at the specified `INDEX` as paid and/or delivered. 
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the currently displayed list. 
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​ 
* Flag `-p` marks the order as paid. 
* Flag `-d` marks the order as delivered. 
* Flags are case-sensitive and specific to the character. 
<br> e.g. `- p` is not a valid flag because there is a space between the `-` and `p`. 
* At least one of `-p` or `-d` must be present in your input. 
* Both `-p` and `-d` may be present in your input to mark an order as both paid and delivered.
* When an order is completed (marked as both `paid` and `delivered`), 
the colour of the particular order's card will be in a darker shade than an uncompleted order. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
You can mark an order with insufficient stock as paid (to record payments for pre-orders) but you **cannot** 
mark an order as **delivered** if there is **insufficient stock** of the item(s) involved in the order.
</div>

Example(s):
* When you enter `marko 4 -p` on our sample data, TrackO will mark the order at index `4` in the currently displayed 
  list as `paid`, as shown below:

  <img src="./images/user-guide/MarkoExample1.png" alt="MarkoExample1">

* When you enter `marko 2 -d` on our sample data, TrackO will mark the order at index `2` in the currently displayed
  list as `delivered`. However, because the order was previously marked as `paid`, the label will show `Completed` and 
  the color of the [order card](#layout) is tinted gray.

### <u>General features</u>

The commands included here are TrackO's general features for you to clear the sample data, access the help window, 
or to exit the application.

[Back to top &#8593;](#welcome-to-trackos-user-guide)

### Getting help: `help`

Shows a window with a link to the user guide.

<img src="./images/user-guide/Help.png" alt="Help">

[Back to top &#8593;](#welcome-to-trackos-user-guide)

### Clearing all data in TrackO: `clear`

If you want to clear all sample data present, `clear` is the command for you. 

The command `clear` clears all data (in both [Order List](#layout) and [Inventory List](#layout)) from TrackO.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
This action is **irreversible**. Please make sure you really want to wipe all of your order and inventory data before proceeding.
</div>

1. Initiate the command to clear all data from TrackO. <br>
    Format: `clear`
2. Confirm the decision to clear all data. <br>
    Format: `confirm` or `cancel`
- `clear` will trigger a message which prompts for user confirmation to clear the data in TrackO.
- Keyword `confirm` : confirms the deletion of all data in TrackO. All data in TrackO will be removed after this input. 
- Keyword `cancel` : aborts the command to clear all data in TrackO. No changes to data in TrackO after this input. 
- `clear` ignores any input after. (e.g. `clear chair` will have the same effect as `clear`)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The keywords `confirm` and `done` are case-sensitive. Thus, only the keywords in lower case are accepted.
</div>

An empty TrackO should look like this:

### Exiting TrackO: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

[Back to top &#8593;](#welcome-to-trackos-user-guide)

### Editing the data file

TrackO's data is saved as a JSON file in `[JAR file home folder]/data/trackO.json`. **Advanced users** are welcome to 
update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, TrackO will discard all data and start with an empty 
data file at the next run.
</div>

[Back to top &#8593;](#welcome-to-trackos-user-guide)

## FAQ

**Q:** How do I transfer the data file to another computer?

**A:** Copy the [home folder](#quick-start) containing your TrackO.jar to the computer you are transferring to. The application should 
work as normal with all the existing data.

<a name ="java-installation"></a>**Q:** How do I make sure that my computer is running Java 11?

**A:** Open the Terminal app built inside your computer (For Windows user, you can also use Powershell) and run the
following [command](#command): `java --version`. The version should then be displayed on the application.
If your screen is displaying `java 11.x.x` where `x` can be any number, then your computer is running Java `11`.

If your computer is not running Java `11`, you can install it [here](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html). 
Please install according to the [operating system](#operating-system) that 
you are using (any of the options is fine, as they are all Java `11`).

**Q:** I am unable to delete my item, what is happening?

**A:** It is likely that the item you are trying to delete is linked to an order that is uncompleted, i.e. not paid or 
not delivered, or both. You need to mark the order as completed (refer to [marko](#marking-an-order-as-paiddelivered-marko)) 
if you want to delete the item.

**Q:** I am unable to edit my item's item name and prices, what should I do?

**A:** Just like the previous question, it is likely that the item you are trying to delete is linked to an order that
is uncompleted. You are not allowed to edit the item's name, cost price, and sell price before you complete te order. 
This is the intended behavior of the application as of `v1.4`, to prevent orders that are already paid to display a 
false revenue.

## Glossary

### CLI

`CLI` stands for `Command Line Interface`. A `CLI` is a text-based user interface in which a program connects to the user. 
Through a `CLI`, users interact with a system or application by typing in commands in the form of text. The system then executes
the typed in command in response.

### Command

An instruction for the application to execute.

### GUI

`GUI` stands for `Graphical User Interface`. A `GUI` is a user interface that provides interactive visual components _(e.g. icons, etc.)_.
Through a `GUI`, users interact with a system or application by clicking on these elements. The system then responds to the user's actions
by updating the user interface.

### Index

`Index` refers to the position of an order or item in the list. When we say that an `item` is at `Index 2`, it means that
the item is currently in the second position on the list.

### Inventory

Any item that the business needs to operate.

### JAR file

`JAR` stands for `Java Archive` and is a file format that is used to store the files to run TrackO. `JAR` files are 
executables, which means that you can run it by double-clicking the file.

### Java

The programming language used to develop TrackO. `Java 11` is also required to run TrackO on your device.

### JSON file

`JSON` stands for JavaScript Object Notation, used for storing the user's data in TrackO. `JSON` files are lightweight, 
text-based, human-readable, and can be edited using a text editor.

### Operating System

An `operating system` is the most important software in your computer that manages all your software and hardware. Linux,
macOS, and Windows may sound familiar to you; they are the operating systems in which TrackO can be run.

### Order

Any sales promise that needs to be fulfilled.

### Parameter

`Parameter`s are the changeable inputs that you can give for a specific part of a command. For example, in the portion 
`i/NAME` of the `addi` command, `NAME` can be replaced with the input that is meaningful to you (e.g, `i/Cookie` or 
`i/Keychain`).
