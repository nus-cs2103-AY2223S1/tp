## Managing your Minecraft friends

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Command format legend:**<br>

* You need to replace the `UPPER_CASE` fields with your desired words.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME m/MINECRAFT_NAME`, you can replace `NAME` and `MINECRAFT_NAME` with names of your choice. <br>
  e.g. `add n/Amy Bee m/amybee123`

* Items in square brackets are optional and can be left out.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Amy Bee t/friend` or as `n/Amy Bee`.

* For items with a `*`, you can provide more than one of such item.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]*` can be used as `n/Amy Bee`, `n/Amy Bee t/friend` or `n/Amy Bee t/friend t/bestie`.

* You can provide the fields in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies the fields to be in the order`n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, 
  arranging them in an alternative order such as `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* Extra words for standalone commands (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

### Viewing help: `help`

Format: `help`

In the `Help` window, upon choosing a specific command, a description
and an example will be shown for that specific command along with the
specific parameters for that command.

* The help window will be launched automatically on startup for new users 
(or if you do not have the file data/addressbook.json) to view the commands 
available in Minefriends. 

* Subsequent launches of Minefriends will not show the help window on launch.

</div>

Example:<br>
Upon typing `help` or clicking on the `help` option, a help window

You can choose a specific command by clicking on the drop-down menu in order to view the
information for that command.

### Adding a friend: `add`

### Editing a friend's information: `edit`
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [m/MINECRAFT_NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS]
[c/COUNTRY] [ms/MINECRAFT_SERVER]* [s/SOCIAL_HANDLES]* [t/TAG]* [gt/GAME_TYPE]* [ti/TIME_INTERVAL]*` <br>

If you want to change an existing attribute of a friend, or fill in optional attributes that were not provided during the `add` process, 
you can use the `edit` command to easily change that. 

The following explains what you should do to edit a particular person.
* Edits the person at the specified `INDEX`. The index refers to the index number shown in your displayed friend list. The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦â€‹
* At least one field must be provided for editing.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* You should not write an **invalid** index.                                           
  * If you have three friends in your friend list, `edit 4 ...` will result in an error. 
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**Important Note:**<br>
* Editing a field with multiple entries will **overwrite all existing values of that field**.<br>
  e.g. `edit 1 t/amiga` will remove all existing tags of the first person and replace them with only `amiga`

* For fields with multiple entries, you can remove all the personâ€™s information in that field by typing the prefix (eg: `t/`) without
including any information after the prefix.

</div>

#### Examples:

##### Editing only single-entry fields
Command: `edit 2 p/91234567 e/amybee123@gmail.com`<br>

Edits the phone number and email address of the 2nd person in the list 
to be `91234567` and `amybee123@gmail.com` respectively.<br>

##### Editing both single-entry and multi-entry fields
Command: `edit 2 n/Amy Bee t/`<br>

and clears all existing tags.

### Deleting a friend: `delete`
Format: `delete INDEX`<br>

You can remove a specified friend from your friend list.

* Deletes the friend at the specified `INDEX` of your friend list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, â€¦
* You should not write an **invalid** index.
  * If you have three friends in your friend list, `delete 4` will result in an error.

Example:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd friend in your friend list.<br>

After delete

### Locating friends by name: `find`
Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`<br>

Finds friends whose names contain any of the given keywords.
You can use this command if you remember their names. Otherwise, the [suggest](#suggest-me-a-friend-suggest)
command is a better option.

* The search is case-insensitive. (e.g. `amy` will match `Amy`)<br>
<br>
Example: <br>
`find Amy` returns `amy` and `Amy Bee`
![FindAmy](images/FindAmy.png)

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Amy Bee` will match `Bee Amy`.
* You can only search for someone's **name**.
* Only **full words** will be matched. (e.g. `Am` will not match `Amy`)

* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned
  (e.g. `Amy Tan` will return `Amy Bee` and `Benson Tan`)
<br>        
Example:<br>
`find amy benson` returns `Amy Bee` and `Benson Tan`<br>
![FindAmyBenson](images/FindAmyBenson.png)

### Suggest me a friend: `suggest`

Suggest friends to play with given a set of constraints.
This command is very versatile. You can find friends based on any attribute of them, including
their available timings to play.

Format: `suggest [dt/DAY_TIME_IN_WEEK]* [k/KEYWORD]*`

* At least one instance of either `DAY_TIME_IN_WEEK` or `KEYWORD` must be provided
* The search is case-insensitive (e.g. `amy` will match `Amy`)
* Keywords do not need to be in full (e.g. `just` will match `Justin`)
* The order of the keywords does not matter
* The `Keyword` will be matched against **all** attributes of a friend (eg. Name, Minecraft Name, Address etc.)
* As long as some attribute of a friend contains the `Keyword`, the `Keyword` is considered to have a valid match
* All `Keyword` must be matched, but only 1 `DayTimeInWeek` needs to be matched
* If you wish to find a friend playing at the same time as you, you can type in `suggest dt/now`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info"> 

**Important Note:**<br>
When you type in `suggest dt/now`, Minefriends uses the current time shown on your computer/device
to search for friends playing at that current time.

</div>

Examples:

`suggest dt/tue@2125 dt/sat@1200 k/Victoria k/Vicky` 
will return friends subjected to **all** of the following conditions:
1. Is available at either Tuesday 9:25pm or Saturday 12:00pm
2. Attributes contain the `Keyword` `Victoria` (ignore case)
3. Attributes contain the `Keyword` `Vicky` (ignore case)

* A friend with name `Victoria Tan` and Minecraft name `vicky12345`, who is available from Tuesday 7pm to 11pm
will be matched
* A friend with name `Victoria Tan` but no other attributes containing `Vicky` will not be matched
* A friend with name `Victoria Tan` and Minecraft name `vicky12345`, who is only available from Sunday 1pm to 6pm
will also not be matched

`suggest k/Victoria`
will return friends subjected to the only condition:
* Attributes contain the `Keyword` `Victoria` (ignore case)

`suggest dt/tue@2125`
will return friends subjected to the only condition:
* Is available at Tuesday 9:25pm

If you type `suggest dt/now` on Sunday 8:00pm, you will return friends subjected to the only condition:
* Is available at Sunday 8:00pm

### Listing all friends: `list`
Format: `list`<br>

Shows a list of all of your Minecraft friends. This command
should be run after a `suggest` or `find` to list out all your friends. 

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

A `suggest` or `find` will filter out your list of friends to produce of shorter list,
so `list` will list out all your friends again.

</div>

Example:

![ListExample](images/ListExample.png)

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from your friend list.

Format: `clear`


### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

In order to navigate the list of autocomplete suggestions, you can either use the `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys,
or simply click on the desired suggestion.

Minefriends data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any 
command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

## FAQ

**Q: How do I transfer my Minefriends data to another Computer?** <br>

**A**: 
Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that
contains the data of your previous Minefriends home folder.

**Q: What is the recommended window size?** <br>

**A**:
The recommended window size is 1280 x 720 pixels, anything smaller may cause the UI to be distorted.

**Q: How long can the parameters be?** <br>

**A**:
As long as you want, however please note that the UI will be distorted if these parameters are too long.

**Q: Why do I need to press `Enter` twice to input the command?** <br>

**A**:
Unfortunately, this is a limitation of ControlsFX, which is a third party library for the autocomplete feature. 
The first `Enter` key press will trigger the autocomplete feature, 
the second `Enter` key press will execute the command.
