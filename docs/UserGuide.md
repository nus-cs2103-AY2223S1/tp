## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

-   Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
    e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

-   Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
    e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

-   Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
    e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

-   Parameters can be in any order.<br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

-   If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
    e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

-   Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
    e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

-   A person is uniquely characterised by their name, phone number and email. You cannot have 2 people with the same name, phone number, and email.
