## How to Use OmniHealth
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

:warning: We **highly recommend** that you read through this section before moving on to our Features and FAQ sections!<br>

</div>

> This section covers all you need to know to start using OmniHealth. 
We will go through the essentials to better understand OmniHealth's [layout](#layout), [navigation](#navigation) and [command format](#command-format).

### Layout
When you launch OmniHealth, you will see OmniHealth's Graphical User Interface (GUI) on your screen. 
Don't be overwhelmed, here's a rundown of the different sections of OmniHealth:

**OmniHealth's GUI:**

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="images/UiAnnotated.png" alt="ui-annotated" width="550"/>
</p>

### Navigation
Managing your patient database is made easy with OmniHealth and navigating it is easier!
This section covers the 2 viewing modes: **Patient List View** and **Record List View** as well as how to **exit a search**.

#### Patient/Record List Views
Navigating in between patients and their records is done easily with 2 commands:
[`rlist`](#listing-all-records-of-a-patient-rlist) and [`list`](#listing-all-patients-list)

Example:
* The **Patient List View** is OmniHealth's default viewing mode.
* Typing `rlist 1` will enter the **Record List View** of `Alex Yeoh`.
* Typing `list` will bring you back to the **Patient List View** showing all the patients.

| Patient List View (Default)              | Record List View                                        |
|------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| ![Ui-patients](images/UiPatients.png)    | ![Ui-records](images/UiRecords.png)                     |
| Command to navigate to this view: `list` | Command to navigate to this view: `rlist PATIENT_INDEX` |

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**

Just remember that toggling between these two screens is easily done with 2 commands: `rlist` and `list`!
</div>


#### Filtered/Unfiltered List Views
OmniHealth's sorting and filtering system allows you to search for specific patients and records in each respective list views.

By default, the Patient List and Record List are **unfiltered** (not filtered by a find command). After using a find command [`find`](#finding-patients-by-name-find) or [`rfind`](#finding-records-by-keyword-rfind), the list will be considered **filtered**.

Example:
* Typing `find alex` will enter the **Filtered List View** where only the matching results are shown.
* Typing `showall` will bring you back to the **Unfiltered List View** showing all the patients/records before the find command was executed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

| Unfiltered List View (Default)              | Filtered List View                                  |
|---------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| ![Ui-unfiltered](images/UiUnfiltered.png)   | ![Ui-filtered](images/UiFiltered.png)               |
| Command to navigate to this view: `showall` | Command to navigate to this view: `find` or `rfind` |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**[`showall`](#displaying-the-full-list-showall) command can be used in both Patient List View and Record List View<br>

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Command Format
Before we introduce more of OmniHealth's commands throughout this User Guide, let's first
go through the general command format.

Here is an example command [`radd`](#adding-a-record-radd):

<p align="center" width="100%">
<img src="images/CommandFormat.png" alt="command-format" width="550"/>
</p>

1. **Command Word**: Determines what action you want OmniHealth to execute.
2. **User Input Fields**: Parameters which you input **valid data** with.
3. **Flags**: Allows OmniHealth to know which user field you wish to input.

Here are some general guidelines for you to better understand the command format for all our [features](#features).

| Last Input          | If an input field is only expected once, only the last of multiple inputs will be considered. | `p/12341234 p/56785678` will be interpreted as `p/56785678`.                |                  
| Extraneous Fields   | For commands that do not take in input fields, unnecessary input will be ignored.             | `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.                                   |

* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `r/Has SARS` will match `SARS Has` stored in record data
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Covid` will not match `Covid-19`.
* The order that the fields are specified does not matter. eg. `r/SARS m/Panadol` is equivalent to `m/Panadol r/SARS`
* FLAGS specify the field of a record that the keywords will be matched to.
  * If the specified field of a record contains at least one matching keyword, the record is returned.
  * e.g. `m/Paracetamol Benzonatate` will return records with medications of `Benzonatate Benzonatate`, `Paracetamol Paracetamol`.
* Specifying more FLAGS increases the constraint of the search.
  * If all fields of a record that is specified by the FLAG contains at least one matching keyword each, the record is returned.
  * e.g. `r/Covid-19 m/cold` will only return records that contains both `Covid-19` in record data and `cold` in record medication.

Examples:
* `rfind r/Covid-19` returns a record with `Covid-19` and `Contracted covid-19` stored in its record data field.
* `rfind r/cold d/10-2022` returns a record that matches both `cold` in the record data field, and has a date within Oct 2022.

## FAQ
**Q**: My computer doesn't have Java 11! How can I install it? <br>
**A**: You can find the details of this on [Oracle's website](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html), 
where there is a comprehensive guide on how to install Java for most existing operating systems.

**Q**: How can I transfer my data to another Computer? <br>
**A**: First, locate the data file as described by the section [editing the data file](#editing-the-data-file). After installing the application in 
your new computer, transfer the old data file into the folder `[JAR file location]/data/`. If an existing `patientlist.json` already exists, 
choose to overwrite the file. You can now open the application in the new computer and your old data will be there!

**Q**: Is there a limit to the number of patients/records that I can add? <br>
**A**: There is a limit of patients and records of about 2 million patients/records. This limit may be expanded in the future if necessary.

**Q**: Do I need an internet connection to use OmniHealth? <br>
**A**: All of OmniHealth's functionality can be used offline! No internet connection is required.

**Q**: Is my data stored on the cloud? <br>
**A**: Unfortunately, there is no cloud saving compatibility currently supported by OmniHealth. However, you can still utilise various
free services such as Google Drive to store your data online if you wish!
The data file can be found in the JSON file under `[JAR file location]/data/patientlist.json`.
