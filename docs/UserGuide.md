--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-3/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your AddressBook.

1. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

    * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

    * **`add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

    * **`delete 3` : Deletes the 3rd **contact** shown in the current list.

    * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

    * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Editing a person also edits them in their respective meetings.
</div>

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the person will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.

### Deleting a person : `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.

Format: `delete INDEX`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Deleting a person also deletes them from their respective meeting(s)
</div>

* Deletes the person at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* A person cannot be deleted if they are the **last person** in a meeting, delete the corresponding meeting first.

Examples:

* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from the address book.

Format: `clear`

### Creating a meeting : `meet`

Creates a meeting and adds it to the meeting list.

Format: `meet [NAMES_OF_PERSONS_TO_MEET (separated by }})] ;;; MEETING_DESCRIPTION ;;; MEETING_DATE_AND_TIME (in dd-MM-yyyy HHmm format) ;;; MEETING_LOCATION`

Example: `meet Alex }} Bernice ;;; Project Meeting ;;; 29-01-2022 1530 ;;; UTown`

Note: Separating names by `}` or `}}}` (or any other variation of `}}`) will likely result in errors
Note: Separating each component of information by `;` or `;;` (or any other variation of `;;;`) will likely result in errors

* The names of the people to meet must correspond to the names of actual contacts, otherwise an error message will be displayed 
* You can choose to type in part of the contact's name (but must be in full word) and the software will match it to the closest contact
  * i.e. There is only one contact called `Alex Yeoh` and inputting `meet Alex ...` will identify the `Alex Yeoh` as the person to meet
  * However, inputting `meet Al ...` will not identify `Alex Yeoh` as `Al` is not a full word in the name
  * NOTE: if there are multiple contacts sharing the same word(s) in their names, the ambiguity will result in an error message and you will be prompted to re-enter a more precise name
  * e.g. if there are two contacts called `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex Lee`, then inputting `meet Alex ...` will result in error
  * However, if there are three contacts named `Alex`, `Alex Yeoh` and `Alex Lee`, then inputting `meet Alex ...` will fetch the contact named `Alex` since it is the contact with an exact name match.
* For the date and time of the meeting:
  * Both the month and day have to be in double digits, e.g. `1-1-2000`, `01-9-2000`, `9-18-2000` will not be accepted, but `01-01-2000`, `01-09-2000`, `09-18-2000` will be
  * Years smaller than 1000 or greater than 10000 will not be accepted as well
  * Time of the meeting has to be in 24h format
  * Dates in the past are allowed, if you would like to archive/ track past meetings
* For duplicate meetings:
  * A meeting is considered duplicate (and an error will be thrown) when you are meeting the same people at the same time.
  * We allow concurrent meetings with different groups of people, as some people might want to arrange both a physical and a virtual meeting at the same time (this is not a feature bug, we have encountered such people before)

### Deleting a meeting : `deletemeeting`

Deletes the selected meeting from the meeting list and UI.

Format: `deletemeeting INDEX_OF_MEETING_DISPLAYED_IN_MEETING_CARDS`

Example: `deletemeeting 1`

* The index refers to the index number of the meeting displayed in the meeting list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

### Add contacts to meeting: `addpersontomeeting`

### Editing a meeting : `editmeeting`

* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.

Examples:

### Listing all meetings : `listmeeting`

Shows a list of all meetings in the address book and console.

### Finding a meeting: `findmeeting`

Finds a meeting by the meeting's description, location or people 

Three Formats: 
- Find by description: `findmeeting /named MEETING_TITLE` 
- Find by people: `findmeeting /with PERSON_NAME` 
- Find by location: `findmeeting /at LOCATION`

For all three formats:
* Only **one** format can be used at a time e.g. they **cannot** be chained like: `findmeeting /named abc /at abc`
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `project` will match `Project`
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Project` will not match `Projects`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Project CS2103` will match `CS2103 Project`
* Only the field specified by the format (description/people/location) is searched.
* Meeting fields matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search). 
  e.g. `CS2100 CS2103` will return meetings with `CS2100 Project`, `CS2103 Project` and
  `Project` will also return meetings with  `CS2100 Project`, `CS2103 Project`
* Keywords are split with a whitespace. e.g. `CS2100 Project` counts as **two** keywords

Examples: 
* `findmeeting /at UTown Com1`
* `findmeeting /with Jane John Simon`
* `findmeeting /named CS2103`

### Filtering Meetings: `filtermeetingsbetween`

Format: `filtermeetingsbetween AFTER_DATE ;;; BEFORE_DATE`

**Note** - all date formats must follow the `dd-MM-yyyy HHmm` format 

Can be split into three cases:
1. `AFTER_DATE` < `BEFORE_DATE` - Lists out all meetings with dates between `AFTER_DATE` and `BEFORE_DATE` not inclusive 
2. `AFTER_DATE` = `BEFORE_DATE` - Lists out all meetings with dates **matching** `AFTER_DATE` which equals to `BEFORE_DATE` 
3. `AFTER_DATE` > `BEFORE_DATE` - Error

Examples: 
* `filtermeetingsbetween 10-10-2022 1050 ;;; 12-10-2022 1200`
* `filtermeetingsbetween 10-11-2022 0000 ;;; 12-11-2022 0000`
* `filtermeetingsbetween 10-11-2022 1000 ;;; 10-11-2022 1000`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, AddressBook will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
