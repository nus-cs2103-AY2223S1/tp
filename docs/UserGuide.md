**Teacher‚Äôs Pet** is a desktop application for managing contacts of students and classes, optimised for use via a
Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
Teacher‚Äôs Pet can get your contact and class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

**Teacher‚Äôs Pet** allows you to manage your schedule and keep track of your students.
The app stores basic information about your students, such as `Name`, `Contact Number`, `Class Date` and more.

Before you get started, you may want to read [how to get started with this User Guide](#reading-the-user-guide)!
To get started with using our application, jump straight to the [Quick Start](#quick-start) section.
For a full list of commands and detailed instructions, head to the [Features](#features) section.

## UI Overview

![Partition](images/UG-screenshots/UiPartition.png)

Our application is divided into 5 areas to maximise productivity, the specific uses are:

1) Command Input - The dialog box where all user interaction are held.

2) Command Result - A short answer whether the application has executed the command, or an error message if the
  application did not understand the command.

3) Student List - A window that will display the details of the student(s).

4) Statistics Window - A window that shows all the statistics of the tutor, such as the number of students and
the money collected/owed.

5) Schedule List - A scroll window which shows the schedule for the day, sorted by time.

Basic Instructions:
1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g., typing `help` and pressing Enter will open
   the help window. Some example commands you can try:
    - `list`: Lists all students.
    - `add n/John Doe p/98765432 np/81239090 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01`: Adds a student named
      `John Doe` to the student list.
    - `delete 3`: Deletes the 3rd student shown in the current list.
    - `clear`: Deletes all students.
    - `exit`: Exits the app.
2. Refer to the Features below for details of each command.

## Reading the User Guide

### Notes about the command format:

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user. e.g., in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter
  which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
- Items in square brackets are optional. e.g., `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/python` or as `n/John Doe`.
- Items with `‚Ä¶` after them can be used multiple times including zero times. e.g., If you see `[t/TAG]‚Ä¶`, you can choose
  not to provide a tag by not using the `t/` prefix, provide one tag like `t/python` or provide multiple tags
  like `t/javascript t/react` etc.
- Parameters with a prefix can be in any order. e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME p/CONTACT_NUMBER`, `p/CONTACT_NUMBER n/NAME`
  is also acceptable.
- If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence
  of the parameter will be taken. e.g., if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will
  be ignored. e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
- Commands that require the use of index from the [Schedule List](#ui-overview) (right side) will be represented as `INDEX-s`,
  while index from the [Student List](#ui-overview) (left side) will be represented as `INDEX`.

### Callouts:
