`CLIMods` is a native desktop application for NUS students to explore, manage and plan academic
modules that they are interested in taking. It is primarily optimised for the use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Power users
of the command line/terminal will be able to plan and manage their modules much faster than doing it
on [nusmods.com](https://www.nusmods.com).

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `climods.jar`
   from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your `CLIMods`.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few
   seconds.<br> 
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
   If double-clicking fails to start the app try these steps instead:
   - Launch a terminal or command prompt on your system
   - Change the current working directory to the _home folder_ 
   - Run the following command: `java -jar climods.jar`

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and
   pressing Enter will open the help window.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

> If no academic year is specified in `preferences.json`, the current academic year (e.g. 2022-2023) will be used.

## Features

### User Manual: `help`

Format: `help`

        - Refer to the FAQ section to learn more about regex!

Search for a (list of) module in the entire list of modules offered by NUS.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
:warning: Regex is difficult, and is intended to be used by more experienced users. This function works fine even without using regex in the query!
</div>

### View module details: `view`

![ViewCommand Demo](images/commands/ViewCommand.png)
![ViewCommand Show Tutorial Demo](images/commands/ViewCommandShowTutorial.png)

Format: `view MODULE-CODE`

Required Arguments:

- `MODULE-CODE`
    - e.g. `CS2103`

View full details (e.g. description, module credits and lesson slots) of a module via its module code.

### Listing module prerequisite: `preq`

![PreqCommand Demo](images/commands/PreqCommand.png)

Format: `preq MODULE-CODE`

Required Arguments:

- `MODULE-CODE`
    - e.g. `CS2103`

Show the list of modules that are the given module's prerequisites.


<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
:warning: Preclusions to prerequisite mods will not be shown due to a limitation with the NUSMods API. (E.g. Only CS1010 will be shown for `preq cs2040`)
</div>

**Note**: `preq` is not always able to show prerequisites for all modules due to limitations of the NUSMods API.
- Some modules may list a prerequisite module code that is no longer offered in the current academic year. Such 
modules will not be shown in the list of prerequisites after running `preq`.
- Some modules have a prerequisite description but the NUSMods API is unable to provide prerequisite module codes 
(e.g `LLJ5479`). 
- The `preq` command does not show and/or relationships between prerequisite modules.

Your added module will display your lesson timings!

Format: `pick MODULE-CODE LESSON-TYPE LESSON-ID`

Required Arguments:

- `MODULE-CODE`
    - e.g. `CS2103`

- `LESSON-TYPE`
    - `TUT`: Tutorial
    - `LAB`: Lab
    - `REC`: Recitations
    - `SEC`: Sectional Teaching
    - `LEC`: Lecture
    - `OTHERS`: Others
  > More lesson types coming soon üòÉ

- `LESSON-ID`
    - e.g. `08J`
  > Tip: Use the `view` command to look at the available lessons!

Pick lesson (e.g tutorial, lab) slots from the available choices for modules that have been selected by the user.

Your list of modules will display your lesson timings!

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Format: `exit`

Exits the program

### Previous/Next command: `<Up>/<Down>`

Using the `<Up>` and `<Down>` arrow keys, users can traverse through the command history.

Traverse/Scroll **up**: `<Up>`

Traverse/Scroll **down**: `<Down>`

> Do note that the implementation of the command history will not keep track of consecutive 
> duplicate commands. This is to prevent clutter in the command history. Therefore, a command
> sequence like `ls CS` followed by another `ls CS` will only have one record in the command history.

## FAQs

1. **What is a `regex` expression?**

    It stands for `regular expression` and is a sequence of characters that specifies a search pattern in text. To learn more about regex, you can refer to [this tutorial](https://regexone.com).

2. **Why can't I visit external links?**

    You are likely coming from our application via the `help` command. It is intended for the user
    to only view our website (including the user guide) via the command. If you wish to visit any external links,
    you can copy the link and paste it into your favourite browser!

3. **Can I update the json file?**

    No! Do not edit the json files on your own! Instead, you should use the command line interface provided by
    CLIMods. We do not take any responsibility for any unexpected behaviour if you insist on editing the json files.

    <div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">
    :warning: If the file is corrupted, please manually delete the file from the directory. 
    Automatic deletion of files is not a feature due to security concerns (e.g. malicious hackers can set the file preference to local files that are not json compatible. Enabling auto-deletion of corrupted files will enable hackers to delete these files.)
    </div>

4. **Why is the application not displaying any modules?**

    CLIMods requires internet access because we fetch module data from NUSMods API.  Please ensure that you have
    internet access before launching CLIMods.

5. **How should I specify the academic year?**

    An academic year is specified in the `YYYY-YYYY` format. Note that specifying identical years (`2022-2022`) will be treated as an invalid academic year.

    Since, `CLIMods` relies on the [`nusmods` API](https://api.nusmods.com/v2) for module data, do note that legacy module data may not be available. For example, since `nusmods` no longer provide module data before `2018`, specifying `2017-2018` or any previous academic years will be treated as an invalid academic year.

    <div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">
    :bulb: **Tip**
    
    - **Valid** ‚úÖ academic year examples: `2022-2023`, `2018-2019`
       
    - **Invalid** ‚ùå academic year examples: `2022-2022`, `2023-2022`, `22-23`
    </div>
