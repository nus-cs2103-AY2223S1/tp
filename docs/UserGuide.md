## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">

**:information_source: Overview of commands:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the information supplied by you.
  e.g `NAME` is a parameter in `create n/NAME`, where you can input `create n/John Doe`.
  <br>

* Parameters in `[]` are optional.
  e.g `HOME_ADDRESS` is an optional parameter in `create n/NAME [a/HOME_ADDRESS]`, where you can input `create n/John Doe a/Blk 30 Geylang Street 29` or just `create n/John Doe`.
  <br>

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times.
  e.g `NAME…​` can be used as `Jon`, `Jon Jack` etc.
  <br>

* `INDEX` represents the index of a specific client in your FABook.
  e.g You can use the command `delete INDEX` as `delete 2`.
<br>

* Parameters can be in **any order**.
  e.g You can input either `create n/NAME p/HP_NUMBER` or `create p/HP_NUMBER n/NAME`.
  <br>

* Only the last occurrence of a parameter that is expected once will be taken **if you specify it more than once.**
  e.g Given `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
  <br>

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`,`clear`, `redo` and `undo`) will be ignored.
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
  <br>

* Names are case-sensitive. e.g. John Doe and john doe are treated as the different names.

### Creation

#### Creating a client contact : `create`

Creates a client contact with their information in your FABook. Any contact information you don't have on hand can be updated later.
<br>

**Rationale**
* If you have multiple meeting times with your client, simply repeat the field `mt/TIME`.
* The `[nw/NETWORTH]` field only accepts inputs that starts with the dollar sign, are numeric,and have more than 4 digits. We want to standardise the currency and the minimum amount net worth of a client.
eg. `nw/$1234`.
* The `[mt/TIME...]` field accepts inputs in the `DD-MM-YYYY-HH:MM` format. Note that `YYYY` ranges from `2000` to `2099`.
* Does not allow you to create a person with the same name and phone number as a current person in the FABook.
* Allows you to create a person with same name but different phone number or same number and different name as a current person in the FABook.

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**:    1. Find the save file on the current computer. The save file can be found as `FABook.json` in the `data` folder created by the app.

   2. Transfer the save file to your new computer.

   3. Install FABook on the new computer.

   4. Launch FABook and exit.

   5. You should see a new `data` folder containing a new `FABook.json`. Replace this file with the save file copied over from your old computer.

   6. Launch FABook again. Your data should be there!

**Q**: Why can I not undo the `sync` command?<br>
**A**: Meetings that have passed should not need to be undone and be shown again.

**Q**: Why does the person profile GUI not refresh after an edit or clear command?<br>
**A**: In order to refresh the person profile, you will have the re-click on the person card again.

**Q**: Why can two clients have the same meeting time?<br>
**A**: We are accounting for cases where perhaps two clients know each other, and they request to listen to a new product together.
