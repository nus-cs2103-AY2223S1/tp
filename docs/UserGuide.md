## Quick start
### Tutorial: Installing PayMeLah

Getting started with PayMeLah is easy! Here is a tutorial on how to get PayMeLah up and running in just **4 simple steps**.

1. Firstly, to run the PayMeLah application, you will need to have *Java 11* or above [installed](https://www.baeldung.com/java-check-is-installed) on your computer ([Mac](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-install-java-on-macos/), [Windows](https://phoenixnap.com/kb/install-java-windows)).

2. Next, you will need to prepare an [**empty folder**](https://www.wikihow.com/Make-a-New-Folder-on-a-Computer) to download PayMeLah to.

3. Now, you will need to visit [**this link**](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/releases) to click and download the latest version of *PayMeLah.jar*. Make sure to download it to the folder you created in step 2! <br>
   <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/howToDownload_1.png" width="500" /></p> <br>
   <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/howToDownload_2.png" width="500" /></p> <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

{:start="4"}
4. Finally, you are ready to use PayMeLah. Simply double-click the *PayMeLah.jar* in the folder you created to start the app. After a few seconds, you should see PayMeLah appear. Notice how we have some sample persons and debts present for you to experiment with our [features](#features).  <br>

<img src="images/Ui.png" width="800" /> <br>

Now, you must be curious as to how to navigate and use PayMeLah. Let’s continue to learn how to [navigate the application](#tutorial-navigating-the-application) before familiarising yourselves with the [features](#features) you can use in PayMeLah.

### Tutorial: Navigating the application

* PayMeLah uses a [Command Line Interface (CLI)](#glossary-command-line-interface-cli) - which means that you perform actions by entering [commands](#glossary-command) for PayMeLah to carry out. If you want to find out more on how to make use of commands, you can jump ahead to learn the [parts of a command](#parts-of-a-command).
* Once a command has been successfully carried out, PayMeLah will display the results accordingly.
* Refer to the diagrams in the following pages to find out about the different components of PayMeLah that are responsible for receiving commands, displaying results, and more!

<img src="images/UiDetails.png" width="800" />

Each section is made of several components which will be explained in the following pages.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Command Line Section

### Tutorial: Adding your first debt

Once you have familiarised yourself with PayMeLah’s [user interface](#tutorial-navigating-the-application), it is time to officially start using PayMeLah! The following section provides a step-by-step guide that walks you through the process of **adding a debt** to PayMeLah in **3 simple steps**. You can choose to follow the sample [commands](#glossary-command) word-for-word, or if you are feeling adventurous, you can try replacing the sample [inputs](#glossary-input) with your own inputs instead.

The guide begins on the following page!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

1. If you are a first time user, your PayMeLah may still be filled with the sample data that came with the [installation process](#tutorial-installing-paymelah). You can **remove all the sample data** with a single [`clear` command](#clearing-all-entries-clear), which you can do by simply entering `clear`. Don’t worry about losing this data - they are unlikely to be useful to you! Soon, your PayMeLah will be filled with the information you actually want instead.<br>

    You should see that the [person list](#person-list-section) is now empty.

   ![Empty person list](images/EmptyPersonList.png)

    <div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

{:start="2"}
2. You can now **add your first person** to PayMeLah with the [`add` command](#adding-a-person-add). The example we will use in this section is `add n/Ryan Tan tele/ryantan123`. Entering this command will add a person named `Ryan Tan` with `ryantan123` as his Telegram handle into PayMeLah.<br>

    You should see that the [person card](#person-list-section) for `Ryan Tan` is now visible in the [person list](#person-list-section). You can click on his name to expand his person card, as per the picture below. However, he does not have any [debts](#glossary-debt) associated with him just yet!

   ![Ryan Tan list](images/RyanTanList.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

{:start="3"}
3. You are now ready to **add a debt** to `Ryan Tan` using the [`adddebt` command](#adding-a-debt-adddebt)! This time, the example we will use is `adddebt 1 d/mcdonalds m/9.80`. Entering this command will add a [debt](#glossary-debt) of `$9.80` with the description `mcdonalds` to the 1st person in the [person list](#person-list-section), who happens to be `Ryan Tan`.<br>

    You should see that the person card for `Ryan Tan` should now be updated. Congratulations! You have just added your first debt to PayMeLah!

   ![YourFirstDebt](images/YourFirstDebt.png)

Of course, this is not yet the end of your journey with PayMeLah - there are still several other commands you may require while using PayMeLah, including commands such as [`deletedebt`](#deleting-a-debt-deletedebt) and [`find`](#locating-persons-by-inputs-find). You can find out more about these commands in the [features](#features) section below.

<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="border: #f1f2f4 solid 1px !important; border-radius: 5px !important; padding: 5px !important; text-decoration: none !important;"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M3.646 11.854a.5.5 0 0 0 .708 0L8 8.207l3.646 3.647a.5.5 0 0 0 .708-.708l-4-4a.5.5 0 0 0-.708 0l-4 4a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .708zM2.4 5.2c0 .22.18.4.4.4h10.4a.4.4 0 0 0 0-.8H2.8a.4.4 0 0 0-.4.4z"/></svg> Return to Table of Contents</a>

## Features

### Parts of a command

As you have learnt in the [navigation section](#tutorial-navigating-the-application), PayMeLah uses a [CLI](#glossary-command-line-interface-cli) to fulfill your needs. Let's take a closer look at what a [command](#glossary-command) consists of!

<img src="images/ExampleCommand.png" width="700" />

* **Command Phrase**<br>
  The first word in the [command](#glossary-command) is the **command phrase** that specifies which command will be carried out by PayMeLah.<br>
  e.g. in the command above, `adddebt` is the command phrase

* **Inputs**<br>
  These are **additional information to be supplied by you**. Check out [input behaviours](#general-input-behaviour) to learn more about how you should type them out!<br>
  e.g. in the command above, `9.80` is an input to specify some amount of money

* **Prefixes**<br>
  To separate inputs that represent different information, you should precede inputs with their respective **[prefixes](#glossary-prefix)** that end with a `/`. <br>
  e.g. in the command above, `d/` is a prefix to indicate that the input after it, `mcdonalds`, is a debt description

<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="border: #f1f2f4 solid 1px !important; border-radius: 5px !important; padding: 5px !important; text-decoration: none !important;"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M3.646 11.854a.5.5 0 0 0 .708 0L8 8.207l3.646 3.647a.5.5 0 0 0 .708-.708l-4-4a.5.5 0 0 0-.708 0l-4 4a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .708zM2.4 5.2c0 .22.18.4.4.4h10.4a.4.4 0 0 0 0-.8H2.8a.4.4 0 0 0-.4.4z"/></svg> Return to Table of Contents</a>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### How to read command formats

In this user guide, we will provide you with the format of each [command](#glossary-command). All you have to do is to follow the format while replacing the necessary parts with your own [inputs](#glossary-input)!<br>
This section will guide you on how to interpret the formats given, so that you can be a master at commanding PayMeLah!

* **User Supplied Inputs**<br>
  Words in diamond brackets `<>` are **inputs to be supplied by you**.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/<name>`, `<name>` is an input which can be used as `add n/John`.

* **Optional Inputs**<br>
  Inputs in square brackets `[]` are **optional**.<br>
  e.g. for `add n/<name> [t/<tag>]…`, the following usages are both acceptable:<br>
  `add n/Alan Poe t/theatre kid`, `add n/Alan Poe`.
  
* **Repeatable Inputs**<br>
  Inputs with `…` can be used **multiple times**, but remember to separate each usage with a space character in between.<br>
  e.g. in `adddebt <person index…>`, `<person index…>` is an input which can be used as:<br>
  `adddebt 1` or as `adddebt 1 2`.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/<name> [t/<tag>]…`, `[t/<tag>]…` is a pair of [prefix](#glossary-prefix) and input which can be used as `add n/Alan t/Poet` or as `add n/Alan t/Poet t/Friend`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Be very careful with how a command is formatted! If the `…` is found within the diamond brackets `<>` that correspond to an input as in `<person index…>`, then only the input itself is to be repeated. However, if the `…` is found outside the `<>` as in `[t/<tag>]…`, then both the prefix and input must be repeated. Read the 2 examples above carefully to see the difference.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### General input behaviour

Just like words in human languages, [inputs](#glossary-input) for PayMeLah [commands](#glossary-command) follow certain rules. Do keep these in mind so that PayMeLah can understand your commands! 

* **Order of Inputs**<br>
  Inputs can be in **any order**.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `d/<description> m/<money>`, `m/<money> d/<description>` is also acceptable.

* **Extra Inputs**<br>
  If an input is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, **only the last occurrence of the input will be used**.<br>
  e.g. if the command requires `p/<phone number>` and you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken. This is useful for correcting a wrong input without having to use backspace.

* **Ignored Inputs**<br>
  Any inputs for commands that do not accept inputs will be **ignored**.<br>
  e.g. entering `help 123` will be equivalent to entering `help`, as it does not accept any inputs.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Avoid giving irrelevant inputs to commands that do not accept those inputs. For example, `mark` expects a `<person index>` input and a `debt/<debt index…>` input, but not a `t/<tag>` input. Giving such inputs may cause unexpected behaviour in PayMeLah!
</div>

<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="border: #f1f2f4 solid 1px !important; border-radius: 5px !important; padding: 5px !important; text-decoration: none !important;"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M3.646 11.854a.5.5 0 0 0 .708 0L8 8.207l3.646 3.647a.5.5 0 0 0 .708-.708l-4-4a.5.5 0 0 0-.708 0l-4 4a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .708zM2.4 5.2c0 .22.18.4.4.4h10.4a.4.4 0 0 0 0-.8H2.8a.4.4 0 0 0-.4.4z"/></svg> Return to Table of Contents</a>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Input-specific behaviour

* **Inputting Dates**<br>
  Whenever `<date>` is specified as an input, you should express it in the format `yyyy-mm-dd` where `y` is year, `m` is month and `d` is day.<br>
  e.g. September 5 2022 should be input as `2022-09-05`.

* **Inputting Time**<br>
  Whenever `<time>` is specified as an input, you should express it in the format `hh:mm` where `h` is the hour in 24h clock format, and `m` is the minute.<br>
  e.g. 5:15PM should be input as `17:15` as per 24h clock notation.

* **Inputting Monetary Values**<br>
  Whenever `<money>` is specified as an input, you should express the amount in dollars and cents. You can also let PayMeLah help you with calculations by ending with `+` to add GST (7%), or `++` to add both Service Charge (10%) and GST (7%) to the amount specified. **All calculated values are automatically rounded up to the nearest cent.**<br>
  e.g. when you input `2.00++`, PayMeLah will interpret the amount with Service Charge and GST added, i.e. `2.36`.

<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="border: #f1f2f4 solid 1px !important; border-radius: 5px !important; padding: 5px !important; text-decoration: none !important;"><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="16" height="16" fill="currentColor" class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up" viewBox="0 0 16 16"><path fill-rule="evenodd" d="M3.646 11.854a.5.5 0 0 0 .708 0L8 8.207l3.646 3.647a.5.5 0 0 0 .708-.708l-4-4a.5.5 0 0 0-.708 0l-4 4a.5.5 0 0 0 0 .708zM2.4 5.2c0 .22.18.4.4.4h10.4a.4.4 0 0 0 0-.8H2.8a.4.4 0 0 0-.4.4z"/></svg> Return to Table of Contents</a>

### Features for Managing Persons

#### Adding a person: `add`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) adds a person to PayMeLah.

**When to use:**<br>
When you want to start tracking [debts](#glossary-debt) owed by a particular person, you can use this command to first add that person (and some of their particulars, like their phone number or Telegram handle) to PayMeLah.
After adding the person to PayMeLah, you can [add debts](#adding-a-debt-adddebt) to them for tracking.

**Format:**<br>
`add n/<name> [p/<phone number>] [tele/<telegram>] [a/<address>] [t/<tag>]…`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A person can have any number of tags (including 0).
</div>

**Additional information:**<br>
* You can only have 1 person of a certain `name`. This means you *cannot* store 2 `Isaac Lee`s with different phone numbers in PayMeLah.

**Examples:**<br>
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 tele/johndoe a/John street, block 123, #01-01` will add a person named `John Doe` with `98765432` as his phone number, `johndoe` as their Telegram handle and `John street, block 123, #01-01` as their address to PayMeLah.
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend a/Newgate Prison t/police` will add a person named `Betsy Crowe` with `Newgate Prison` as their address and both `friend` and `police` as their tags to PayMeLah.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Editing a person: `edit`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) edits an existing person in PayMeLah.

**When to use:**<br>
When a person’s particulars in PayMeLah have changed (e.g. phone number or Telegram handle), you can use this command to update them!

**Format:**<br>
`edit <person index> [n/<name>] [p/<phone number>] [tele/<telegram>] [a/<address>] [t/<tag>]…`

**Additional information:**<br>
* Edits the person at the specified `<person index>` in the currently displayed [person list](#person-list-section).
* At least one of the [optional fields](#how-to-read-command-formats) must be provided.
* Pre-existing values will be updated to the input values.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without
  specifying any tags after it.

**Examples:**<br>
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 tele/johndoe` will edit the phone number and Telegram handle of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `@johndoe` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` will edit the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clear all their existing tags.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Deleting a person: `delete`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) deletes the specified person from PayMeLah.

**When to use:**<br>
When you no longer need to track [debts](#glossary-debt) for a particular person, you can use this command to remove them from PayMeLah.

**Format:**<br>
`delete <person index>`

**Additional information:**<br>
* Deletes the person at the specified `<person index>` of the currently displayed [person list](#person-list-section).

**Examples:**<br>
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st person in the results of the `find` command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Features for Managing Debts

#### Adding a debt: `adddebt`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) adds a [debt](#glossary-debt) to a person in PayMeLah for you to track. Specifying multiple persons will add a copy of this debt to each person specified.

**When to use:**<br>
When you want PayMeLah to keep track of a debt for one particular person, or the same debt for multiple persons, this is the command to use!

**Format:**<br>
`adddebt <person index…> d/<description> m/<money> [date/<date>] [time/<time>]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can tell PayMeLah to add Service Charge and GST to the amount of money specified by including `++` at the back of the amount. A single `+` will add only GST instead.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You might find it difficult to find the [person index](#glossary-person-index) of a specific person when your list gets long. In this situation, you may want to make use of the [`find` command](#locating-persons-by-inputs-find) or [`finddebt` command](#locating-persons-by-debt-description-finddebt) to shorten the list and make it easier to find and figure out the person index of the person that you are looking for.
</div>

(Continued on next page!)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Additional information:**<br>
* If you specify **neither date nor time**, the date and time will conveniently default to the current date and time.
* If you specify **only the time but not the date**, the date will conveniently default to the current date.
* If you specify **only the date but not the time**, the time will default to midnight.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Be very careful! The default behaviour is slightly different across the different combinations of whether you provided date and time inputs.
</div>

**Example:**<br>
* `adddebt 3 d/McDonalds m/8.9` will add a debt with the current date and time to the 3rd person in the [person list](#person-list-section). This debt is worth `$8.90` and has the description `McDonalds`.
* `adddebt 1 4 d/chicken rice m/10++ date/2022-10-12 time/13:00` will add debts with `2022-10-12` and `13:00` as the date and time respectively to **both** the 1st person and 4th person. These debts require Service Charge and GST to be added to an initial price of `$10`, and will be recorded with the description `chicken rice`. Note that PayMeLah will automatically calculate the money for both debts and display the amounts as `$11.77`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Splitting a debt: `splitdebt`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) splits a [debt](#glossary-debt) evenly among several persons in PayMeLah for you to track.

**When to use:**<br>
When you want to divide a group expense equally between multiple persons, you can use this command to let PayMeLah help you with the calculations and keep track of their debts!

**Format:**<br>
`splitdebt <person index…> d/<description> m/<money> [date/<date>] [time/<time>]`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can split a debt among as many persons as you want. You can even include yourself with the special [person index](#glossary-person-index) `0`. But you cannot split a debt between just yourself.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You might find it difficult to find the [person index](#glossary-person-index) of a specific person when your list gets long. In this situation, you may want to make use of the [`find` command](#locating-persons-by-inputs-find) or [`finddebt` command](#locating-persons-by-debt-description-finddebt) to shorten the list and make it easier to find and figure out the person index of the person that you are looking for.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
Splitting a debt is just like [adding a debt](#adding-a-debt-adddebt) to multiple persons; however, here we divide the money of the debt over the persons who shared it (and round up to the closest cent). Thus, you can similarly tell PayMeLah to add Service Charge and GST to the amount of money specified by including `++` at the back of the amount. A single `+` will add only GST instead.
</div>

(Continued on next page!)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Additional information:**<br>
* If you specify **neither date nor time**, the date and time will conveniently default to the current date and time.
* If you specify **only the time but not the date**, the date will conveniently default to the current date.
* If you specify **only the date but not the time**, the time will default to midnight.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Be very careful! The default behaviour is slightly different across the different combinations of whether you provided date and time inputs.
</div>

**Examples:**<br>
* `splitdebt 1 2 d/Pizza m/33.99` will add debts with the current date and time to the 1st and 2nd person in the [person list](#person-list-section). This debt has the description `Pizza`and is worth `$33.99` in total before being divided by 2, over the 1st person and the 2nd person. Note that PayMeLah will automatically calculate the money for both debts and display the amounts as `$17.00`.
* `splitdebt 0 2 5 d/KFC chicken bucket m/30+ date/2022-10-12` will add debts with `2022-10-12` and with the default `00:00` as the date and time respectively to **both** the 2nd person and 5th person. These debts will be recorded with the description `KFC chicken bucket` and require GST to be added to an initial total price of `$30` before dividing the costs by 3, over yourself, the 2nd person and the 5th person. Note that PayMeLah will automatically calculate the money for both debts and display the amounts as `$10.70`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Deleting a debt: `deletedebt`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) deletes the specified [debts](#glossary-debt) from a person in PayMeLah. Specifying multiple debts will delete those debts from the person specified.

**When to use:**<br>
When you no longer need to track some particular debt(s) owed by a person, you can use this command to remove them from PayMeLah!
You can also [mark a debt as paid without deleting it](#marking-debts-as-paid-mark) if you still wish to keep track of it.

**Format:**<br>
`deletedebt <person index> debt/<debt index…>`

**Example:**<br>
* `deletedebt 2 debt/2 3` will delete the 2nd and 3rd debt, regardless of paid or unpaid, of the 2nd person in the current displayed [person list](#person-list-section).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Clearing debts: `cleardebts`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) clears all of a person's [debts](#glossary-debt) from PayMeLah.

**When to use:**<br>
When you no longer need to keep track of any debts of a person, you can use this command to clear their [debt list](#debt-list-section)! If you want to stop keeping track of only some of a person's debts, you can [delete specific debts](#deleting-a-debt-deletedebt).

**Format:**<br>
`cleardebts <person index>`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You might find it difficult to find the [person index](#glossary-person-index) of a specific person when your list gets long. In this situation, you may want to make use of the [`find` command](#locating-persons-by-inputs-find) or [`finddebt` command](#locating-persons-by-debt-description-finddebt) to shorten the list and make it easier to find and figure out the person index of the person that you are looking for.
</div>

**Example:**<br>
* `cleardebts 3` will delete all the debts, regardless of paid or unpaid, from the 3rd person in the current displayed [person list](#person-list-section).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Marking debts as paid: `mark`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) marks the [debts](#glossary-debt) specified from a person in PayMeLah as paid. Specifying multiple debts will mark all those debts as paid.

**When to use:**<br>
When you want to indicate that a particular debt has been paid, but still keep a record of it in PayMeLah, this is the command to use!

**Format:**<br>
`mark <person index> debt/<debt index…>`

**Example:**<br>
* `mark 2 debt/2 3` will mark the 2nd and 3rd debt of the 2nd person in the current displayed [person list](#person-list-section) as paid.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Marking debts as unpaid: `unmark`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) marks the [debts](#glossary-debt) specified from a person in PayMeLah as unpaid. Specifying multiple debts will mark all those debts as unpaid.

**When to use:**<br>
When you realise that a debt you had previously [marked as paid](#marking-debts-as-paid-mark) is actually not paid yet, you can use this command to indicate that it is still unpaid.

**Format:**<br>
`unmark <person index> debt/<debt index…>`

**Example:**<br>
* `unmark 2 debt/2 3` will mark the 2nd and 3rd debt of the 2nd person in the current displayed [person list](#person-list-section) as unpaid.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Getting the statement: `statement`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) gets a statement of the total value of [debts](#glossary-debt) you are owed by everyone in the displayed [person list](#person-list-section).

**When to use:**<br>
When you want to quickly find out the total amount of money you are owed, you can use this command to let PayMeLah do the calculations for you!

**Format:**<br>
`statement`

**Additional information:**<br>
The statement will only sum up the debts that are marked as unpaid from the list that is currently displayed. This means that if you have shortened the list using the [`find` command](#locating-persons-by-inputs-find) or [`finddebt` command](#locating-persons-by-debt-description-finddebt), the statement will only sum up the debts that are marked as unpaid from the shortened list.

**Example:**<br>
`statement` displays "You are owed $583.90 in total." when there are 2 persons in the displayed [person list](#person-list-section), who owe you $100 and $483.90 respectively.

### Features for Searching

#### Locating persons by inputs: `find`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) finds and displays persons who match all the given search conditions.

**When to use:**<br>
When you are looking for specific person(s) in PayMeLah, you can use this command to filter the displayed [person list](#person-list-section)!

* At least one input must be provided, `find` cannot work with no inputs.

(Continued on next page!)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<span id="combining-inputs-to-find">**Combining inputs to `find`:**</span>

When you provide multiple search condition inputs to `find`, only persons matching all conditions will be shown to you.

Additionally, do note that when multiple search conditions filter for persons by a [debt](#glossary-debt) in their [debt list](#debt-list-section), PayMeLah will show you persons with at least one debt that matches all the inputs.

Examples:
* `find n/hans p/81234567` will match `Hansel` or `Hans Gruber` if his phone number is `81234567`.
* `find d/burger n/hans` will match `Hansel` if he owes money for `burger`.
* `find d/burger m/10` will match anyone who owes `$10.00` for `burger`.
* `find above/10 below/20 d/fries` will match anyone who owes between `$10.00` and `$20.00` inclusive for `fries`.
* `find before/2022-11-30 after/2022-11-01 time/11:00` will match anyone who owes money for something at `11:00` during the month of November 2022.
* `find tele/janesmith above/10 below/20 before/2022-11-30 after/2022-11-01` will match anyone with the Telegram handle `@janesmith` who owes between `$10.00` and `$20.00` inclusive for something during the month of November 2022.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Locating persons by debt description: `finddebt`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) finds and displays persons who owe any [debts](#glossary-debt) that match any of the given keywords.

**When to use:**<br>
When you do not remember the exact description of a debt you want to look for (e.g. was it `KFC meal` or just `kfc`?), this is the command to use!

**Format:**<br>
`finddebt <keyword…>`

**Additional information:**<br>
* The ordering of the search keywords does not matter. e.g. the keywords `Sharing Meal` will match `Meal Sharing`.
* Only the descriptions of the debts are searched for the keywords.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. `Burger` will not match `Burgers`.
* Persons with debts matching at least one keyword will be displayed.
  e.g. `burger meal` will display persons associated with debts that have descriptions `Chicken Burger` or `Meal Sharing`.

**Examples:**<br>
* `finddebt Burger` displays persons associated with debts that have descriptions `burger` or `Chicken Burger`.
* `finddebt burger meal` displays persons associated with debts that have descriptions `Chicken Burger` or `Meal Sharing`.<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Listing all persons: `list`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) displays the full [person list](#person-list-section) in PayMeLah.

**When to use:**<br>
When you have previously filtered the displayed [person list](#person-list-section) (using commands such as [`find`](#locating-persons-by-inputs-find) and [`finddebt`](#locating-persons-by-debt-description-finddebt)) and want to view the full list again, this is the command to use!

**Format:**<br>
`list`

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Listing debtors: `listdebtors`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) shows a list of all persons that owe you more than or equal to a certain amount of money in PayMeLah. If no amount is provided, a list of persons who owe any amount of [debt](#glossary-debt) is displayed.

**When to use:**<br>
When you want to quickly find out who owes you significant amounts of money, this is the command to use!

**Format:**<br>
`listdebtors [m/<money>]`

**Example:**<br>
`listdebtors m/10` displays the list of persons that owe more than $10.00.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Sorting list of persons: `sort`

**What it does:**<br>
This [command](#glossary-command) sorts and displays the [person list](#person-list-section) using the given criterion and order.

**When to use:**<br>
When you want to organise your data in PayMeLah, you can use this command to arrange the [person list](#person-list-section) in an order you like!

**Format:**<br>
`sort <criterion prefix><order>`

**Additional information:**<br>
You can use the following criterion prefixes to sort by the respective criterion:
* `n/` - Name of person
* `m/` - Total amount of money owed by person
* `date/` - Time since date of the oldest debt owed by person

Do note that you can only sort by exactly one criterion at a time.

Use the following symbols after the criteria prefix to indicate the order of sorting:
* `+` - Ascending order
* `-` - Descending order

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
When you sort by "Time since oldest debt", all persons who do not owe any debts will be placed at the end of the list, regardless of whether ascending or descending order is specified.
</div>

**Example:**<br>
`sort n/+` sorts and displays the [person list](#person-list-section) in ascending alphabetical order of their names.

## Advanced Features

Rest assured that the information in this section is **optional**!

This following section is meant for advanced users of PayMeLah who are already comfortable with the basic features and are looking to further increase their efficiency in using PayMeLah. If you are a new user still getting used to PayMeLah, don't worry about reading this section yet. You can always come back to this section in the future after gaining more experience!

### Keyboard shortcuts

Although you can use the mouse to help navigate PayMeLah, it can be faster if you do not have to lift your hand from your keyboard at all. This is where keyboard shortcuts will come in handy for **speeding up your navigation** of the application.

The table on the next page lists every keyboard shortcut currently available in PayMeLah!

### Features for Data Management

#### Saving your data

Your computer automatically saves PayMeLah data after any [command](#glossary-command) that changes it. There is no need to save manually! Within the folder you saved your PayMeLah, you might have noticed that there is a _data_ folder. As the name suggests, your PayMeLah data is saved in a _paymelah.json_ file within that folder.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">
:bulb: **What is a JSON file?**<br>
A [JSON file](https://fileinfo.com/extension/json) is a common type of file used by many applications to store data in a format easily readable and editable by advanced users.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Editing your data file

You can actually update the data in PayMeLah without even launching the application! To **save time**, advanced users are welcome to update data by directly editing _paymelah.json_.

Here is a quick tutorial on editing the data file:

1. Double-click on the _paymelah.json_ file to open it.<br>
   You should see some text similar to the following (don't worry if the words in your file appear to be in a different colour, it does not matter):<br>
   <p style="text-align:center;"><img src="images/jackson.png" width="350" /></p>

2. You can now edit the data by changing any of the green words you see here in our example image! Do ensure that your replacement words are surrounded by double-inverted commas (`" "`), as per the image above.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:**<br>
Make sure your edits still follow the [requirements of each input](#input-specific-behaviour)! For example, if you edit the date, it should still be in the `yyyy-mm-dd` format.<br>

If the data file fails to follow the required format, PayMeLah will **discard all data** and start with an empty data file the next time you launch it. This is **irreversible**! As such, please edit the data file directly only after you have already backed up your data in another file.

## FAQ

**Q1**: Do I **need to save** my data manually?<br>
**A**: Nope! You don't have to worry about saving your data manually at all! PayMeLah automatically saves your data for you. If you are interested to learn more, you can head to the [saving your data](#saving-your-data) section.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q2**: How do I **transfer my data** to PayMeLah on another computer?<br>
**A**: Here is a simple 4-step guide to transfer your data!

1. Find your current data file. By default, it should be a `paymelah.json` file found in your `data` folder. See more under [saving your data](#saving-your-data).

1. [Install PayMeLah](#tutorial-installing-paymelah) on your new computer!

1. Launch PayMeLah on your new computer, then exit the application.

1. You should now see a `data` folder within the folder that you saved PayMeLah. Enter the `data` folder and replace the `paymelah.json` file in your new computer with your `paymelah.json` file from your old computer.

The next time you launch PayMeLah on your new computer, your data should be updated to reflect the data in your old computer!

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Q3**: I **can't find something** that I know I have added to PayMeLah. Where did it go?<br>
**A**: If you are trying to locate a person, try using the [`find` command](#locating-persons-by-inputs-find)! When searching for names, the `find` command displays partial matches, so it will find `Bobby` even if you search for `bob`.<br>
If you are trying to locate a debt without knowing its full description, consider using the [`finddebt` command](#locating-persons-by-debt-description-finddebt) instead.<br>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Other Tips:** <br>
1. You can try [combining inputs](#combining-inputs-to-find) to refine your search, but sometimes, you cannot find something because you may have misremembered a detail like the date, or keyed it into PayMeLah wrongly by accident. In this situation, you may want to consider not making your search too specific, or using `before/` and `after/` inputs to search around a date instead of on that specific date.<br><br>
2. As a last resort, the [`list` command](#listing-all-persons-list) will list every person in PayMeLah. You can then [sort the list](#sorting-list-of-persons-sort) to make it easier to manually check through the list. If you still cannot find the person or debt you are looking for in the full [person list](#person-list-section) displayed by `list`, then unfortunately it means the item you are looking for is not in PayMeLah.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q4**: PayMeLah is **not letting me use the command** I want! What can I do?<br>
**A**: Oh no! Calm down - let's troubleshoot together. First, head to the [Command Summary](#command-summary) section to make sure you are using the command in the correct format. You can also click on the links there to read more about the specifics of each command. If PayMeLah continues to misbehave, do drop us an email at [paymelah.app@gmail.com](mailto:paymelah.app@gmail.com), and we will do our best to help you as soon as possible!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Q5**: Why **can't PayMeLah do _this_?**<br>
**A**: We are so sorry that PayMeLah does not support this feature at the moment :( However, PayMeLah is a constant work in progress and we hope to deliver the features that you are looking for in the near future! In the meantime, feel free to drop us feedback at [paymelah.app@gmail.com](mailto:paymelah.app@gmail.com) so that we can better understand and serve your needs :)
