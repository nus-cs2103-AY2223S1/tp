HackAssist is a desktop application which aims to help manage tasks in software development hackathons. In hackathon projects, task management is often hectic because we are required to complete a large number of tasks in a short amount of time. However, with HackAssist, we aim to make your task management workflow easier, so you can focus on building your hackathon project :)

This guide provides an overview on how to perform the main functionalities of HackAssist: [People Management](#people-management) and [Tasks Management](#tasks-management).

For advanced users, you can go straight to the [Command Summary](#command-summary).

## Features

This section provides information on how you can use HackAssist commands for people management and tasks management.
You can click [General](#general) to learn about general commands, [People Management](#people-management) to learn about commands specific to People Management, or [Task Management](#tasks-management) to learn about commands specific to Task Management.

Before you learn any commands, please read the following notes about HackAssist command format.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Any parameters given for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

<br>

### People Management

#### Adding a person: `add`

Adds a new person to the address book.
* Note: You cannot add a task if another task with the same name already exists in the task list.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: Tip:
A person can have any number of tags (including 0)
</div>

Refer to the [Person Parameters](#person-parameters) section for details about the format of each parameter.

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 `
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com a/Newgate Prison p/1234567 t/criminal `

#### Deleting a person: `delete`

Deletes the specified person from the address book.
* Note: This will delete the person permanently

Format: `delete INDEX`

* Deletes the person at the specified INDEX.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list.
* The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2 ` deletes the 2nd person in the address book.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1 ` deletes the 1st person in the results of the find command, which should be Betsy.

#### Editing a person: `edit`

Edits an existing person in the address book.
The values inside [] indicate optional fields
Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]…​`


* Edits the person at the specified INDEX. The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed person list. The index must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided, otherwise you would not be updating anything.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
*  None of the provided optional fields may be of the same value as the original value
* When editing tags, all existing tags of the person will be removed and completely replaced with the new tags.
* You can remove all the person’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.
* To edit what tasks a person is assigned to, instead of editing the person, edit the relevant task. The edit will be reflected in the person list after you edit the task. There is no way to edit a task using the edit person command.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com` edits the phone number and email address of the 1st person to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` edits the name of the 2nd person to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

#### Locating persons by name: `find`

Finds persons whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]`

* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. hans will match Hans
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. Hans Bo will match Bo Hans
* Only the names of people will be considered.
* Only full words will be matched e.g. Han will not match Hans
* Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. only one keyword has to match).
  e.g. Hans Bo will return Hans Gruber, Bo Yang, despite the fact that neither match Hans Bo (both names match at least one word)

Examples:
* `find John` returns john and John Doe
* `find alex david` returns Alex Yeoh, David Li<br>

#### Listing all persons: `list`

Shows a list of all persons in the address book.
This command can be used to reset the displayed person list after a find command.

Format: `list`

<br>

### Task Management

The following commands are for viewing and managing your hackathon tasks. These tasks may be related to software development, product design, project presentation etc. Each task can be assigned to a person to represent that they are responsible for completing that task.

#### Adding a task: `addTask`

Adds a task to the task list. Note that you cannot add a task if another task with the same name already exists in the task list.

Format: `addTask n/TASK_NAME d/DESCRIPTION pr/PRIORITY c/CATEGORY dl/DEADLINE [pe/EMAIL_OF_PERSON_ASSIGNED]`

* If the optional parameter `pe/EMAIL_OF_PERSON_ASSIGNED` is provided, the task will be assigned to that person. If not, it will remain unassigned. This might be useful at the beginning of your project when you are scoping out the tasks that need to be done.

Refer to the [Task Parameters](#task-parameters) section for details about the format of each parameter.

Examples:

* `addTask n/Fix toggle d/Fix dark mode button pr/low c/frontend dl/2022-12-12` adds task `Fix toggle` to the task list
* `addTask n/Fix routing d/Handle routing for POST req pr/high c/backend dl/2022-11-11 pe/john@example.com` adds task `Fix routing` to the task list and assigns it to person with email `john@example.com`

#### Deleting a task: `deleteTask`

Deletes a task from the task list.
* **Note: The task will be permanently deleted**. To mark a task as `completed` but have it remain in the task list, use the [`editTask`](#editing-a-task-edittask) command instead.

Format: `deleteTask INDEX`
* Deletes the task at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the task number shown in the displayed task list.
* The index **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Examples:
* `deleteTask 1` deletes the first task from the displayed task list

#### Editing a Task: `editTask`

Edits the parameter(s) of an existing task in the task list. You can also use this command to mark tasks as `completed` or to assign the task to a person in your team.

Format: `editTask INDEX [n/TASK_NAME] [d/DESCRIPTION] [pr/PRIORITY] [c/CATEGORY] [dl/DEADLINE] [pe/EMAIL_OF_PERSON_ASSIGNED] [do/IS_DONE]`

* Edits the task at the specified `INDEX`. The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown in the displayed task list. It must be a positive integer 1, 2, 3, …​ and less than or equal to the number of tasks in the task list.
* At least one of the optional fields must be provided.
* None of the provided optional fields may be of the same value as the original value
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* To un-assign a person from a task, write `none` in the EMAIL_OF_PERSON_ASSIGNED field, i.e. `pe/none`.
* To mark a task's status as `completed` or `not completed`, write `true` or `false` in the IS_DONE field, e.g. `do/true`.

Refer to the [Task Parameters](#task-parameters) section for details about the format of each parameter.

Examples:
* `editTask 2 c/frontend pe/charlotte@example.com` edits the category of the 2nd task in the displayed task list to be `frontend` and assigns the task to  the person with email `charlotte@example.com`.

* Only full words will be matched e.g. Dark will not match Darkmode
* Task with names or descriptions matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search).
  e.g. Fix will return Fix toggle, Fix routing

Examples:
* `findTask fix` returns Fix toggle and Fix routing
* `findTask dark` returns Fix routing (description: Fix **dark** mode button)

#### Filtering tasks: `filter`

Filters the task list based on either CATEGORY or DEADLINE or both. Use this when you want to view only tasks in a certain category or before a certain deadline.

Format: `filter [c/CATEGORY] [dl/DEADLINE]`

* Filters the task list based on the parameters provided.
* At least one of the optional parameters must be provided.
* Only tasks that match the filter condition will be displayed in the task list.
