InternConnect is a **desktop app for managing internship applicants, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This one-stop, convenient, and efficient platform empowers Internship Campus Recruiters to work with their applicantsâ€™ data. Say goodbye to opening multiple windows to retrieve the information you need and focus on what matters more: matching the right people for the right job.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 3. Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* An address book cannot have multiple applicants with the exact same identity fields (`EMAIL` and `JOB_ID`)
  e.g., `n/John e/j@example.com ji/J12332` and `n/Jason e/j@example.com ji/J12332` are considered the same applicant.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameter details to be supplied by the user.
  e.g., in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Bobby Doe`.

* Items with `...` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.
  e.g. `[t/TAG]...` can be used as nothing (i.e. 0 times), `t/KIV`, `t/KIV t/offered` etc.

* Curly brackets represent a set of at least 1 parameter, and each of them is mandatory.
  e.g., `{mandatory_field_parameter/FIELD_DETAIL}`, all fields that belong to mandatory fields must be listed.

* Items in square brackets are optional.
  e.g., `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/Bobby t/KIV` or as `n/Bobby`

* Parameters can be in any order, and are separated by a space.
  e.g., if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE e/EMAIL`, `n/NAME e/EMAIL p/PHONE` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit`, `export` and `clear`) will be ignored.
  e.g., if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* All leading and trailing whitespaces will be trimmed, while multiple whitespaces in between words will be replaced by a single whitespace.

* All find command keywords and duplicate checks for applicants are case-insensitive.
  e.g., `JACOB@example.com` will be considered equal to `jacob@EXAMPLE.COM`.

* The search is case-insensitive. E.g., `bobby` will match `Bobby`.
* Applicants matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e., _OR_ search). E.g., `n/Bobby Cortez` will return applicants with the name `Bobby Lacruz`, `Alexander Cortez`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. E.g., `Bobby cortez` will match `Cortez bobby`.
* Multiple field search: Across different fields, an _AND_ search is done, while an _OR_ search is still done within each field for its keywords. E.g., `n/Bobby Cortez g/male` will return male applicants with names matching `Bobby` or `Cortez`.

Search Types:
1. Matching word: Keywords will only match if there is a full matching word. E.g., `Bobby` will not match `Bobbys`.
2. Substring: Keywords will match as long as a substring match exists. E.g., `@gmail.com` will match `jason@gmail.com` and `CS2103@gmail.com`
