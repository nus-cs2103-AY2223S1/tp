NutriGoals is a desktop application for **NUS students who wish to improve their current lifestyle and adopt a healthier one**.
With NutriGoals, you can **keep track of your diet and calorie consumption**. Studies have shown the benefits of keeping 
track of your daily food consumption â€“ the more consistent you are, the more likely you are to achieve the various 
fitness goals that you have set for yourself! However, without the right tools, tracking what you have consumed is 
tedious and disorganised. With NutriGoals, you can keep track of your consumption quickly and easily, without 
worrying about organising your data.
