## **Introduction**
Hi Profs! Welcome to the User Guide for **Tuthub**, a Command Line Interface (CLI) App that will help you find your next batch of teaching assistants (TA) in no time!

Tuthub is a desktop app for NUS professors who wish to track and choose their next batch of teaching assistants/tutors based on their past performance and records but have little time to spare for tedious administrative work. Tuthub helps profs who can type fast find the best TAs faster than traditional Graphical User Interface (GUI) apps.

### Command Format
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Some general rules that Tuthub commands follow:**
* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/good` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…` after them can be used as many times as the user would like.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…` can be used multiple times like `t/good` or `t/good t/highRatings`, or can be omitted altogether.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Frequently Used Command Parameters

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Some notes about parameters:**

* Parameters with a prefix can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will ignore follow-up inputs.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

</div>

| Parameter              | Note                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

</div>

### Search for tutor by attribute: `find`

Searching for tutors that teach relevant or specific modules? Looking for tutors with the best ratings? The find
command allows you to do so by searching through the list of tutors based on specified attributes of the
tutors along with the search keywords provided.

Format: `find PREFIX/KEYWORDS [KEYWORDS]`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**
* The find command works by entering only **one prefix** corresponding to a tutor's profile attribute, followed by the keyword(s) to search
* Multiple find commands executed consecutively do not act upon the list of tutors that each find command has resulted in. e.g. Entering `find m/cs2100` after `find n/alex` will not find tutors teaching CS2100 from the list of tutors that `find n/alex` outputted.
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g. `find n/hans` will match `Hans`
* The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `find n/Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
* Only the attribute that corresponds to the prefix entered is searched.
* **Partial words** will be matched for the following tutor attributes: `NAME`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `EMAIL`, `MODULE`, `YEAR`, `STUDENT_ID`, `TEACHING_NOMINATIONS`, `TAG`. e.g. `find n/Han` will match `Hans`
* For `Rating` attribute, matching is done based on whether the rating of a tutor starts with the keywords searched. e.g. `find r/4` will match both `4.99` and `4.15`
* Tutors with attributes being searched that match at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. OR search). e.g. `find n/Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber` and `Bo Yang`

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">

:bulb: **Tip:**
Refer to [this section](#frequently-used-command-parameters) for more information about various parameters!

</div>

Examples:
* `find n/John` returns all tutors with names that contains `John`.
* `find n/alex david` returns all tutors with names that contain `Alex` or `David`, as shown below:

![find](images/user-guide/find.png)

* `find p/98765432 99999999` returns the tutors with phone number `98765432` or `99999999`.
* `find e/e1234567 e7654321` returns the tutors with email `e1234567@u.nus.edu` or `e7654321@u.nus.edu`.
* `find m/cs2100 cs2105` returns the tutors teaching module `cs2100` or `cs2105`.

### Contacting tutors via email: `mail`

Contacting targeted tutors is made easy with the mail command. The command opens the user's default mail client and specifies the "to" section in emails with the targeted tutors.

Format: `mail INDEX` or `mail all`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**
* `INDEX` refers to any index in range of the tutor list.
* `all` allows you to email all the current tutors displayed in the tutor list.

</div>

Examples:
* `mail 3` opens the user's default mail client with the "to" specified as the third tutor's email.
* `mail all` opens the user's default mail client with the "to" specified as all the currently displayed tutors' emails, as shown below.

![mail](images/user-guide/mail.png)

### Sorting tutors by quantitative measures: `sort`

Looking for tutors with the best reviews? The sort command allows you to sort the
list of tutors in ascending or descending order based on different quantitative
measures, such as rating and teaching nomination. More specifications on the sort command is visible below.

Format: `sort ORDER PREFIX`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**
* `ORDER` can be one of the two values: `a` (ascending) or `d` (descending).
* `PREFIX` refers to one of the prefixes of quantitative measures (e.g. `r/`).
* Currently, sort is implemented for the prefixes `r/` (`RATING`) and `tn/` (`TEACHING_NOMINATIONS`).
* Sort only accepts **one prefix**, hence `sort a tn/ r/` will return an error.

</div>

Examples:
* `sort a r/` sorts the tutors in ascending order (low to high) based on tutor ratings.
* `sort d tn/` sorts the tutors in descending order (high to low) based on tutor teaching nominations.

### Deleting a tutor: `delete`

Deletes the specified tutors from Tuthub. This could be useful if you are removing tutors that have already graduated or if you are trying to better organise Tuthub to only contain tutors that you have hired.

Format: `delete INDEX`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:exclamation: **Caution:** Deleting a tutor is **irreversible**! Only enter this command when you are very sure that the tutor profile is not needed anymore!

</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd tutor in Tuthub.
* `find n/Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st tutor with name containing `Betsy` in the results of the `find` command (given that such tutor exists).

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears all entries from Tuthub. You may find this particularly useful if you would like to clear all the sample data when using Tuthub for the first time.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">

:exclamation: **Caution:** Clearing all the data is **irreversible**! Only enter this command when you are very sure that all the existing tutor profiles are not needed!

</div>

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits Tuthub app.

Format: `exit`

## **FAQ**

**Q**: How do I save my data in Tuthub?<br>
**A**: Tuthub data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command is executed. There is no need to save manually.

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains the data of your previous Tuthub home folder.

**Q**: Why is my previous data not loaded properly into Tuthub?<br>
**A**: It is highly likely that your data storage file has something in the wrong format. It is recommended to check the log files to see what happened when Tuthub started up.
