## Features

### Introduction to Our Features

This section summarizes all the commands supported in `NUSEatWhere`. 
We highly recommend you read this section before jumping into all the features below!

1. When in doubt, you can always fall back on the `help` command.
For most commands, you can also add `-h` to the back to get `NUSEatWhere` to generate 
a help message on how to use the command (e.g. `find -h`)!

2. To show all eateries, or reset the eateries in the list to its default state, use `list`.

3. Make use of the various search commands (`find`, `findTag`, `findLocation`, `findCuisine`, `findPrice`) 
to search for a specific eatery!

4. Make use of our random generator by adding `-r NUMBER` after any `find` command. For example, run
`find -r 1` to generate 1 random eatery to eat at.

5. Customize `NUSEatWhere` to suit your needs by adding tags to your eateries.
You can use the `tag` and `untag` commands to change the tags attached to each eatery.

6. Additionally, you can use the `fav` and `unfav` commands to mark some eateries as favourites!

7. Lastly, we empower you to `add`, `edit` and `delete` eateries to and from `NUSEatWhere`. 
This may be useful to include eateries near NUS (such as Supper Stretch!).

### Important! A Note on Command Format

| Command Expression     | Meaning                                                      | Example                                                                                                                   |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UPPER_CASE`           | Upper case inputs are **needed** for the command to work     | In `add -n NAME`, `NAME` is an input which can be used as `add -n Pasta Express`                                          |
| `[]`                   | Inputs in square brackets are **optional**                   | `-n NAME [-p PRICE]` can be used as `-n Pasta Shop -p $` or as `-n Pasta Shop`                                            |                                                                                  |
| `…​`                   | Items with `…​` after them can be used **one or more times** | `find NAME…​` can be used as `find Frontier`, `find Frontier Deck` etc.                                                   |
| `-n`, `-t`, `-p`, etc. | Prefixed inputs can be in **any order**                      | if the command specifies `-n NAME -t TAGNAME`, you can also use `-t TAGNAME -n NAME`. Both will produce the same outcome. |

  Note: For `-t TAGNAME1 [-t TAGNAME2]…​`, the correct input format is `-t mala -t vegetarian`. (Multiple `-t`s are required)

* If a certain input is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times,
  only the last occurrence will be taken. <br>
  e.g. if you specify `-n nameA -n nameB`, only `-n nameB` will be taken. <br><br>

* Extra inputs for commands that do not take inputs (such as `help`) will be ignored. <br>
  e.g. `help 123` will be interpreted as `help`.<br><br>

* The special `-h` parameter will provide a useful help message for how to use the command. 
  To avoid any unforeseen behaviour, remove your other inputs when using `-h`.
  e.g. `find -h` or `add -h`.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## FAQ

**Where is my data saved?** <br>
NUSEatWhere's `Food Guide` data (including your tags and any new eateries) is automatically saved into the file named
`foodguide.json` in the `data` folder.

**How do I transfer data to friends or other devices?** <br>
Make a copy of the data file (`foodguide.json` in the `data` folder) and transfer it to your friend or the other device
by any means of file sharing (thumbdrive, email, Google Drive, etc.). In the other installation of
`Food Guide`, replace the default data file with your data.

**How can I manually edit `Food Guide` data?** <br>
If you are familiar with the `json` file format, you may edit the data file `foodguide.json` directly 
using a text editor. Do make a backup as an invalid data file will cause `NUSEatWhere` to override 
it with an empty file.

**I would like to modify/build on NUSEatWhere, how do I go about this?** <br>
