# ConnectNUS User Guide

ConnectNUS is **designed for NUS Computer Science students** by providing a centralised platform for them to keep track
of their and their friends' modules and timetables. With features such as adding previous, current and
future modules, as well as timetables, ConnectNUS provides you with the convenience of viewing your friends' schedules
and eliminates the hassle of having to search through multiple group and private chats to know when your friends will
be free to meet up to do group projects. You can also use the module filters to help you find friends who have previously
taken, currently taking or interested in taking the specified module.

ConnectNUS is **optimised for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a
**Graphical User Interface** (GUI). For Computer Science students who are generally fast typers, ConnectNUS is an
excellent platform for you to get your CS related tasks management done quickly, so you can spend less time searching
through chats, and spend more time making meaningful connections and engaging in productive work.

The goal of this User Guide is to empower you, as NUS Computer Science students, with the knowledge to **maximise the full
potential** of ConnectNUS and capitalise on the features ConnectNUS offers for you to make your CS experience
**better than better**.

Before you start using ConnectNUS, you are recommended to read the [Navigating the User Guide](#navigating-the-user-guide),
[Glossary](#glossary), [Quick Start](#quick-start) as well as [Notes about the command format](#notes-about-the-command-format)
sections, which will provide the necessary information to allow you to familiarise yourself with the structure of this
User Guide and help you navigate it with ease.

If this is your first time using the ConnectNUS application, you are advised to read through the **entire** User Guide **in the sequence
provided**.

Whenever you are in doubt, forget the command formats for any feature, need help troubleshooting
or you simply want to maximise your use of this application, do remember to revisit this User Guide.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Navigating the User Guide

For each of the [Features](#features) in this User Guide, you will be provided with
1. An overview of the feature to introduce its purpose and function.
2. The command format to use the particular feature.
3. Sample commands for you to try out the feature.
4. Explanations on valid command parameters.
5. Some include screenshots of the expected behaviour of the sample command to help you understand how the command works.

The Features in the User Guide are grouped according to their functions :
- [User profile features](#user-features)
- [Contact list features](#contact-list-features)
- [Module features](#module-features)
- [Timetable features](#timetable-features)
- [Filtering features](#filtering-features)
- [Other features](#other-features)

You can jump to the specific section of the user guide which you require using the Table of Contents on the first page
of the User Guide. This enables you to learn about all the related information you need to know regarding the respective
features. You may click on [Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents), which can be found at the end of every section, to
gain quick access to the Table of Contents, enabling you to redirect yourself to another section if necessary without
having to manually scroll through the User Guide.

If this is your first time using a Command Line Interface, you are recommended to go through the entire user guide according
to the sequence laid out in the user guide, as well as trying out the sample commands provided in each feature to gain
a better understanding of how a Command Line Interface works.

Once you are proficient with the various command types, you may refer to the section [Command Summary](#command-summary),
which will provide you with a quick glance summary of all the command formats of all features provided by ConnectNUS.

As recommended in the introduction, we would like to direct you to read the [Glossary](#glossary) section next.

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><strong>Command Line Interface (CLI)</strong></td>
    <td>
      A text-based interface that is used to operate software (such as ConnectNUS) and operating systems. CLI
      allows a user to perform tasks by entering commands. <br>
      Users enter the specific command, press “Enter”, and then wait for a response.
      After receiving the command, the CLI processes it accordingly and shows the output/result on the screen.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## Quick Start

Step 1: Ensure you have Java 11 or above installed on your computer. You can refer to
[this](https://www3.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/howto/jdk_howto.html#zz-2) guide to help you install and configure
an appropriate version of Java. You can open a command window and run the `java -version` command to ensure you are using
Java 11 (or above).

  <img src="images/QuickStart1.png" width="390" />

Step 2: Download the latest ConnectNUS.jar from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-4/tp/releases/tag/v1.3).

  <img src="images/QuickStart2.png" width="390" />

Step 3: Copy the file to a new empty folder you want to use as the home folder for ConnectNUS. A JSON file will be created in
the folder to store your data upon saving the jar file.

  <img src="images/QuickStart3.png" width="390" />

Step 4: In terminal (Mac) or command prompt (Windows), navigate to the folder's path. For Mac users, you can do it by right-clicking on the folder
and click on `New Terminal at Folder` as illustrated below.

  <img src="images/QuickStart4.png" width="390" /> <br />
  <img src="images/QuickStart5.png" width="390" />

Step 5: Launch the jar file using the `java -jar ConnectNUS.jar` command in the terminal. Do not double-click
on the jar file in the folder. This to ensure the jar file is using the correct Java version verified in Step 1.

  <img src="images/QuickStart6.png" width="390" />

Step 6: The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Do note that the app contains some sample data.

  <img src="images/Ui.png" width="390" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 7: Refer to the [Features](#features) section below to for more details on how to use ConnectNUS.

As recommended in the introduction, we would like to direct you to read the [Notes about the command format](#notes-about-the-command-format) section next.

[Scroll back to top](#table-of-contents)

## Features

These are features implemented within ConnectNUS.

These features are split into the following purposes:
- [Help](#viewing-help)
- [User profile features](#user-features)
- [Contact list features](#contact-list-features)
- [Module features](#module-features)
- [Timetable features](#timetable-features)
- [Filtering features](#filtering-features)
- [Data features](#data-features)
- [Other features](#other-features)

You may refer to each individual section for more information on the purpose and function of these features.

Each feature can be run using a command, and the commands follow the following format:

## Notes about the command format

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be **supplied by you**. \
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are **optional**. \
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…`​ after them can be used **multiple times including zero times**. \
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.
* Parameters can be **in any order**. \
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, **only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken**. \
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored. \
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
