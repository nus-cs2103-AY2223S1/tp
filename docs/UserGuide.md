Travelr allows you to plan trips around the activities in your bucket list. You will be able to keep track of your bucket list, travel dates, travel locations, and trip itineraries, all within the same app!

In this guide, you will be introduced to the various features of Travelr, which will help you to use Travelr to build up your bucket list, plan future trips, and look back on your past trip experiences in an effective manner.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.
2. Download the latest `Travelr.jar` [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/releases).
3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for Travelr.
4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI should appear in a few seconds, and will look similar to the screenshot below. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)
5. Type the command in the input box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * `list-e` : Lists events in the bucket list.

   * `add-e n/Sightseeing d/Visit Mountains` : Adds an event with the respective title and description into your bucket list.

   * `delete-e 3` : Deletes the 3rd event in the bucket list.

   * `exit` : Exits the app.
6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Parts of our GUI
**Notes about the UI:**

On app startup, the Trip List Display will show all trips and the Event List Display will display
the events in the bucket list i.e Events that haven't been added to any trips.

Trips can be marked as completed via the [`mark`](#marking-trips-as-completed-mark) command. Completed trips will be labelled with a tick icon
to the right of the trip's title.

The trips display sorts the trips by completion automatically. Completed trips will remain at the bottom of the list.

Titles, locations and descriptions that are too long will be truncated. To view the full details of an event or trip, use [`display-e`](#displaying-specified-event-details-display-e) and [`display`](#displaying-specified-trip-details-display) commands respectively.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-block alert-warning">
   
**:warning: Notes about the command format:**<br>

|`Component`|`Formatting Details`|
|:-:|:--|
|**Input**| Words in UPPER_CASE are the inputs to be supplied by the user. <br> e.g. in `add n/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION l/LOCATION D/DATE`, `TITLE`, `DESCRIPTION`, `LOCATION`, and `DATE` are inputs which can be used as `add n/Switzerland Trip d/With family and friends l/Switzerland D/29-09-2022 `|
|**Optional Inputs**| Items in square brackets are optional. <br> e.g `sort [by/FACTOR] [r/]` can be used as `sort by/time r/` or as `sort`. |
|**Prefixes**| The relevant prefixes must be used to separate parameters supplied by the user. <br> e.g. in `add-e n/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`, `n/`  and `d/` are two designated used to separate the two parameters supplied which can be used as `add-e n/Sightseeing d/Visit mountains`.|
|**Unnecessary inputs** | Unnecessary inputs for commands that do not require inputs (such as `list`) will be ignored. <br> e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.|
|**Ordering of inputs**| Inputs can be in any order. <br> e.g. if the command specifies `n/TITLE d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION n/TITLE` is also acceptable.|
|**Multiple inputs**| If an input is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the input will be taken. <br> e.g. if you specify `n/Singapore Trip n/Malaysia Trip`, only `n/Malaysia Trip` will be taken.|
|**Case Sensitivity**| `TITLE` is case-sensitive, so titles with the same letters and spacing but different capitalizations will be considered different. This applies for both events and trips. This is done in order to allow for the differentiation of words with different meanings when different capitalizations are used.<br> e.g. Two different trips with titles `December Turkey trip` and `December turkey trip` may refer to two different trips, where the former refers to a trip to Turkey, while the latter refers to a trip that involves the consumption of turkey.|
|**Duplicates**| Events with the same title are considered duplicates, and duplicate events are not allowed. <br> Trips with the same title are considered duplicates, and duplicate trips are not allowed.|
