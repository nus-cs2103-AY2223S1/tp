## Before Using PennyWise

### What is an Entry

Think of PennyWise as a helpful personal budgeting assistant. Whenever you spend or earn money, all you need to do is
tell PennyWise and PennyWise will log it and save it! An Entry is what PennyWise terms as a
particular expenditure or income logged into the application. PennyWise defines an expenditure and income as things that
you spend money on, and things that make you money respectively! Not only that, PennyWise will help you analyse your
data, so you can easily get an overview of your overall expenditure or income.


However, in order to do this, PennyWise will need some data from you! Whenever you log an entry, whether expenditures or
incomes, you need to tell PennyWise the following:

* Type: whether it is an expenditure or income
* Description: what is this particular entry about
* Amount: what was the amount associated with this particular entry
* Date: when was this entry logged in PennyWise
* Category: how this entry is classified

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
In PennyWise, there is an upper limit of $1 000 000 for amounts.
</div>

### Familiarising yourself with the interface

Let's get acquainted with the application with the help of the following diagram!

When you first open up the application, this is the *default view*, which shows the list of expenditures:

![UserInterfaceExplanation](images/ug/UserInterfaceExplanation.png)

|                                        Component                                         |                                                                       Explanation                                                                       |
|:----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------:|
|     ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=List%20Display&color=862e9c)     |          Where you view your entry lists (Expenditure or Income) <br> This can be filtered by the [`view`](#view-entries-by-category) command           |
|    ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Graph%20Display&color=5c940d)     | Where you view your entries in a graphical overview (Pie Chart or Line Graph) <br> This can be modified by the [`view`](#view-entries-by-month) command |
| ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Command%20Input%20Box&color=e67700)  |                                                     Where you enter your commands to use PennyWise                                                      |
| ![](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?label=&message=Command%20Output%20Box&color=d9480f) |                                                Where you see the output of your commands from PennyWise                                                 |

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Warning**
If the application is resized to a smaller screen, certain graphical components will be hidden. This is to ensure that
you still see the most important information about your budgeting. If details of your budgeting are important, use PennyWise in fullscreen instead!

1. Pie Chart Legend <br/>

   - The Pie Chart Legend will be hidden should the application be of a smaller size. This ensures your categorical
     overview can still be seen at a glance!
     ![ChartLegend](images/ug/ChartLegend.png)

2. Line Graph Dates

   - Certain Line Graph dates will be hidden should the application be of a smaller size. This ensures you can still view
     the trend of your entries easily.
     ![LineGraphDates](images/ug/LineGraphDates.png)

## Understanding the command formats

All commands follow this format except: [`delete`](#deleting-entries),
[`clear`](#clearing-all-entries), [`exit`](#exiting-the-program) and [`help`](#command-summary-table).<br>
<pre>
    command | entry identifier | input | [optional inputs]
</pre>

For example, given the command `add t/e d/Lunch a/15.60 da/15-08-2022 c/Food`, let us deconstruct the command format
step-by-step!

|      Format      |                Example                 |
|:----------------:|:--------------------------------------:|
|     Command      |                 `add`                  |
| Entry Identifier |                 `t/e`                  |
|      Input       | `d/Lunch a/15.60 da/15-08-2022 c/Food` |
|  Optional Input  |                  NIL                   |

- Letters followed by a forward slash is called an identifier and will be used to specify a specific parameter<br>
  e.g. `t/` refers to the entry type parameter.

- PennyWise will always take the **LAST OCCURRENCE** of a command identifier should there be more than 1 of the same command
  identifier in a given command. <br/>
  e.g. PennyWise will add the following **Income** with the description: "October Allowance" upon running the following command.
  
  ```
  add t/i d/Monthly Allowance a/200.00 da/01-10-2022 c/Allowance
  d/Oct Allowance d/October Allowance
  ```
  
  You should expect to see this output:

    ```
    New entry added: October Allowance; Date: 01-10-2022; Amount: 200.00;
    Tag: Allowance
    ```

- PennyWise will **IGNORE** any extra words or characters present after the following commands:

  [`summary`](#summary-of-entries) (except [`summary [mo/MONTH]`](#summary-of-all-entries-in-the-specified-month)),
  [`help`](#command-summary-table), [`clear`](#clearing-all-entries) and [`exit`](#exiting-the-program).
  e.g. `summary abcdefg` will be interpreted as `summary` and `help 123456` will also be interpreted as `help`.

- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters that you must supply<br>
  e.g. In `delete INDEX_OF_ENTRY t/ENTRY_TYPE`, `INDEX_OF_ENTRY` is a parameter which can be used as `delete 10 t/e`.

- Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `view t/ENTRY_TYPE [MONTH]` can be used as `view t/e mo/2022-05` or as `view t/e`.

- **ALL** identifiers are <ins>case-sensitive</ins>.
  e.g. `d/Lunch` as a descriptor for "Lunch" is accepted by PennyWise, however `D/Lunch` would not be accepted.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Adding identifiers that are not used in the command will result in an error.
</div>

### Categorising your expenses and income

For **ALL** entries, categories are <ins>COMPULSORY</ins> and every entry can only contain <ins>one</ins> category. The
following table lists the **Expenditure** and **Income** entries categories. The category names are <ins>
case-insensitive</ins>. E.g. `Food` is same as `food`.

|    Expenditure    |     Income      |
|:-----------------:|:---------------:|
|     **Food**      |   **Salary**    |
|   **Groceries**   |  **Allowance**  |
| **Entertainment** |   **Profit**    |
|   **Education**   | **Investments** |
|    **Housing**    |    **Gifts**    |
|    **Others**     |   **Others**    |

For example, an expense entry can be tagged with `Food`, but not `Salary`.

### Guidelines on organising your expenses and income

For **ALL** entries, 2 entries are considered duplicates <ins>IF</ins> both entries have exactly the same:
`description`, `date` `amount` and `category`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
Having multiple duplicate entries will make it difficult for you to track your expenses later on, and could clutter the list.
Having them differentiated will make it easier for you to recall what you spent your money on!
</div>

If you want to log similar entries, you can simply use the [edit](#editing-entries)
command to alter the original entry's specifications.

For example, when executing the following [add commands](#adding-entries) one after another, PennyWise will recognise (2), which is the second `Teh Beng` added as a duplicate entry.

<pre>
    <code>
        1. add t/e d/Teh Beng a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/food
        2. add t/e d/teh beng a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
    </code>
</pre>

To add similar entries, vary the description/amount/date/category to let PennyWise know they are not duplicates!

<pre>
    <code>
        1. add t/e d/Teh Beng 11am a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
        2. add t/e d/Teh Beng 4pm a/1.50 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
    </code>
</pre>

OR we could even [edit](#editing-entries) the original entry directly to reflect 2 cups of `Teh Beng` consumed.

<pre>
    <code>
        1. edit 1 t/e d/2 Teh Beng 11am a/3.00 da/22-10-2022 c/Food
    </code>
</pre>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Info:**
Descriptions are case-insensitive as well! PennyWise will interpret `Teh Beng` as the same as `teh beng`.
</div>

|---------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
You can think of the view entries by month command as applying a month filter to the entry list,
and view entries by category command as clearing any filters on the entry list. <br/>
To switch back to the [default view](#familiarising-yourself-with-the-interface) of the list of expenditures, 
simply use the [`view t/e` command](#view-entries-by-category). If you would like to switch back to the 
[default view](#familiarising-yourself-with-the-interface) of the list of income, you can use the 
[`view t/i` command](#view-entries-by-category).
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-danger">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Note that if you manually switch between the income list display and expenditure list display, all filters (if any)
will be cleared and a pie chart will be drawn. Manual toggling is equivalent to typing the command 
[`view t/e`](#view-entries-by-category) or [`view t/i`](#view-entries-by-category).
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: Can I use PennyWise without internet? <br>
**A**: Absolutely! In fact, PennyWise is meant to be used as an offline application. This means that your personal data
will be even more secure as well!

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer? <br>
**A**: Install the app in the other computer and overwrite the empty data file it creates with the file that contains
the data of your previous PennyWise home folder.

**Q**: Why is my edit and delete command invalid? I am sure I included all the required parameters. <br>
**A**: Make sure that your `INDEX_OF_ENTRY` is the first parameter after the command word.

**Q**: I want to have a `Medical` category to log my expenses. Is there anyway I can do it? <br>
**A**: The categories for income and expenses entries are fixed. However, we are exploring the possibilities of [user
added categories](#categorising-your-expenses-and-income) so do look out for our software updates! 
For now, kindly categorise them under `Others`.

**Q**: Why are there missing dates on my Line Graph? <br>
**A**: PennyWise automatically removes certain elements to ensure you can still get an overview of your finances!
If you want to view all the dates, enlarge your application!

**Q**: I prefer a date format like 4 Apr 2022. Why can't I pick the date format I want to use ? <br>
**A**: Unfortunately PennyWise currently only accepts one type of format which is `04-04-2022`. However, we are exploring
the possibilities of allowing more types of date formats without compromising on quality and user experience so do look
out for our future software updates!
