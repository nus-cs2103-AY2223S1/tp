TaskBook is a **desktop app for managing contacts and tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TaskBook can get your contact and task management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

TaskBook helps NUS students to manage all their tasks, from project-related and module-related tasks, to even daily personal tasks!

In this user guide, you will find instructions on how to install TaskBook and use its many features to manage your tasks.

Choose a topic from the table of contents below to find out how to manage your apps using TaskBook!

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Using the Examples in this Guide

The examples in this guide are formatted with the following conventions:
* **Command** - Instructions to be typed into the command box. Will be executed when you press enter.
* **Flag** - Indicators to differentiate various parts of a command. Always of the form `$/`, and is followed by a **parameter**. The `$` varies by **command**.<br>E.g: `s/` in `task sort s/SORT_TYPE`, or `i/` in `contact delete i/INDEX`.
* **Parameter** - Component of a **command** that is prefixed by a flag.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Commands, parameters and arguments are case-sensitive, unless otherwise specified.

* Non-ascii characters are removed from user input.

* Flags consisting of a character and `/` specify the type of parameter to be supplied.
  e.g. in `n/NAME`, `n/` is the flag for the `NAME` parameter.

* The `NAME` parameter for all commands must be the **full name** of the contact 
  e.g. if the contact is named `Alex Yeoh`, a command must use `n/Alex Yeoh` and not `n/Alex` or `n/Alex Y` etc.

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [#/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe #/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Diamond brackets mean that at least 1 item inside them must be supplied by the user. <br>
  e.g. `task find <q/QUERY a/ASSIGNMENT x/DONE>` can be used as `task find q/John` or as `task find a/FROM x/X`, but not just `task find`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times. Otherwise, they can only be used once by default.<br>
  e.g. `[#/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `#/friend`, `#/friend #/family` etc, while `n/NAME` (which does not have the square brackets and `…`​) must be used exactly once.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `task list`, `contact list` and `bye`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `bye 123`, it will be interpreted as `bye`.

</div>

Example:

1. `contact sort s/a` dislays a contact list where names are sorted by alphabetical order.
   * Given 3 contacts: alfonzo, Alpha, and Betsy, the ordering of the list will be: Alpha, Betsy, alfonzo.

#### Sorting tasks : `task sort`

Sorts your task list based on the input parameter.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-light">

**:computer: Format:** `task sort s/SORT_TYPE`

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: SORT_TYPE parameters:**<br>
* ca: Chronologically sort tasks by date and time added.
* a: Alphabetically sort task descriptions.
* ra: Alphabetically sort task descriptions in reverse order.
* cd: Chronologically sort tasks by their associated dates in ascending order. Tasks without dates are at the end of the list, in no particular order.
* rcd: Chronologically sort tasks by their associated dates in descending order. Tasks without dates are at the end of the list, in no particular order.

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note about alphabetical sorting:**<br>

* Alphabetical sorting for tasks are not case-sensitive. Between any lower-case letter and their capital counterpart, there is no guarantee on the order of the sort.

</div>

Example:

1. `task sort s/a` displays a task list sorted by description alphabetical order.
   * Given 3 tasks with descriptions: Walk the dog, Do homework, do chores, the order of the list will be: Do homework, do chores, Walk the dog.

### Undo and Redo

#### Undo Command : `undo`

Undoes the previous command and reverts your TaskBook to the previous state.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-light">

**:computer: Format:** `undo`

</div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about Undo:**<br>

* Up to 15 commands can be undone.
* Commands can only be undone if there is a change in contact or task state.
* Undo does not reset the view changes caused by filter or sort. See [contact list](#listing-all-contacts--contact-list) and [task list](#listing-all-tasks--task-list) instead.

</div>

Example:
1. `task todo m/Bob d/Add undo feature` - some command that causes a change in state.

2. `undo` will undo the previous command.

#### Redo Command : `redo`

Redoes the previous undo action and reverts your TaskBook to a previously undone state.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-light">

**:computer: Format:** `redo`

</div>

Example:
1. `task delete i/1` - some command that causes a change in state.

2. `undo` will undo the previous command.

3. `redo` will revert the state such that the task is deleted.

## Miscellaneous Notes

### Accepted Date Formats

Any of these date formats are accepted:

* yyyy-MM-dd (2022-10-31)
* MMM dd yyyy (Oct 31 2022)
* MM dd yyyy (10 31 2022)
* dd MMM yyyy (31 Oct 2022)

### NAME Parameter

Where the NAME parameter is required (e.g. `n/NAME`), specify the **exact name**
* in full
* in a case-sensitive format

This prevents ambiguity in naming so that you can specify the exact contact where necessary.

### PHONE_NUMBER Parameter

Phone numbers must consist of only numerical inputs 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9. TaskBook does not support country code extensions.

Phone numbers must be at least 3 digits long, as the shortest phone numbers in the world (emergency hotlines) are 3 digits long.

### TAG Parameter

The tag parameter `#/TAG` accepts only alphanumeric inputs and **no blank spaces**. (e.g. `#/friend` or `#/bestFriend` and **not** `#/best friend`)
