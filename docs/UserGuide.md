## 6. Tutorial

### 6.1 Basic features

Are you new to *MyInsuRec*? This section is the place to start!

Here, we will be guiding you on the basic features of *MyInsuRec* and helping you get familiarized with it.

* When we first launch *MyInsuRec*, *MyInsuRec* will have already been preloaded with some sample data. We will be using this sample data to get familiar with *MyInsuRec*!

* Type in `addClient n/Tommy Tan p/81234567` to add a client named 'Tommy Tan' who has a contact number '81234567'. We will see the list of clients update to include this newly added client, with his phone number! The image below shows *MyInsuRec* after adding Tommy.

![AddClientTommy](images/quick-start/AddClientTommy.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">**:information_source: Note:**
Both client name and their phone number are **needed** to add the client into *MyInsuRec*.
</div>

* Tommy has also given us his email address, his address, as well as his birthday. As such, we would like to update Tommy's record. To do that, we first need to get Tommy's index from the list of clients, which is 7. Type in `editClient i/7 e/tommytan21@gmail.com a/167 Canning Road bd/25081982` and hit enter. Tommy's record in the list of clients will update with the newly inputted details. The image below shows *MyInsuRec* after updating Tommy with the additional details.

![EditClientTommy](images/quick-start/EditClientTommy.png)

* We can also directly add these optional fields (email, address, etc.) when we are adding the client for the first time! So, `addClient n/Tammy Lim p/90127654 e/tammylim@hotmail.com b/09091973` also adds in the client's email and birthday directly.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">**:bulb: Tips and tricks:**
See [addClient](#711-adding-a-client-addclient) for more variety of optional fields!
</div>

* Now we would like to add in an upcoming meeting with our client 'Bernice Yu' (index 2 in our sample data). We can do that by doing `addMeeting i/2 d/27102022 st/1400 et/1600 dn/Review Product 2` (You can replace `d/27102022` with today's date in the DDMMYYYY format)! When we hit enter, *MyInsuRec* will show us the list of meetings, including the one we just added. The image below shows the list of meetings after adding the meeting with Bernice.

![AddMeetingBernice](images/quick-start/AddMeetingBernice.png)

* We would like to get Bernice's contact number and message about her upcoming meeting! We can call `viewMeeting i/1` to help us. This brings up a more detailed view of the meeting, with information such as description of the meeting and Bernice's contact number. The image below shows *MyInsuRec* after using the `viewMeeting` command.

![ViewMeetingBernice](images/quick-start/ViewMeetingBernice.png)

* Now, to go back to the list of clients, simply type in `listClient`. This brings us back to the list of clients. The image below shows the current state of *MyInsuRec* after following all the previous steps.

![ListClient](images/quick-start/ListClient.png)

* Suppose your company introduced a new product 'MyInsureCare' that you are interested to sell, and would like to add it into *MyInsuRec*! We can do so via `addProduct pd/MyInsureCare`. This adds a product 'MyInsureCare' and also brings us to the list of products, including the newly added one. The image below shows *MyInsuRec* after adding the product.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">**:bulb: Tips and tricks:**
You can use `listClient`, `listMeeting` and `listProduct` to traverse between the different lists accordingly.
</div>

![AddProductMyInsureCare](images/quick-start/AddProductMyInsureCare.png)

* Now, we want to add a client named who has already purchased 'MyInsureCare'. To do that, we can once again type in `addClient n/Ng Jun Yi p/81230987 pd/MyInsureCare` to add a client and indicate that he has bought 'MyInsureCare'. The image below shows *MyInsuRec* after adding the client with the product.

![AddClientJunYiWithProduct](images/quick-start/AddClientJunYiWithProduct.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**:exclamation: Caution:**
Only products added already via `addProduct` can be used! This is to help ensure the cleanliness of *MyInsuRec*. So, add your product via `addProduct` before using it to add a client with that product! See [addProduct](#731-adding-a-product-addproduct).
</div>

* Unfortunately 'Alex Yeoh' is no longer our client, and so we want to delete him from our records. To do that, type in `delClient i/1`. The image below shows *MyInsuRec* after deleting the client.

![DelClientAlex](images/quick-start/DelClientAlex.png)

And there we have it! We have just gone through the basic bookkeeping features of *MyInsuRec*. Beyond that, we also have more advanced features such as getting a quick glance of all your upcoming meetings, filtering clients by products. To find out and learn more about these features, head to the [Features section](#7-features) where all the commands and their details can be found.

To get started with a clean state of *MyInsuRec*, type in the command `clear`. This removes all the sample data from *MyInsuRec*, so don't panic if you see that all your data are wiped off!

Welcome to your new and organized life, and happy (financial) advising!

## 7. Features

This section guides you on how to use features available in *MyInsuRec*. We will lay out the command and parameters needed to use the feature, and show some examples as well as its expected behaviour. We also include some tips and tricks (yay!) on how you can better use the feature and *MyInsuRec*.

**Do take some time to read the following note** to better understand how you can use this section!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by you.<br>
  e.g. in `addClient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `NAME` and `PHONE_NUMBER` are parameters which can be used as `addClient n/John Tan p/12345678`.


* Items in square brackets are optional, while those not in square brackets are compulsory.<br>
  e.g. `addClient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [b/BIRTHDAY] [pd/PRODUCT]` can be used as <br>
  * `addClient n/John Tan p/12345678`
  * `addClient n/John p/12345678 e/John@abc.com b/12122000`


* This symbol `||` indicates that only one of the optional parameters can be used. <br>
  **Using more than one optional parameter is strictly not allowed.** <br>
  e.g. `listClient [pd/PRODUCT || b/BIRTHDAY]` can be used as
  * `listClient pd/Product1`
  * `listClient b/week`


* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.


* Suppose you entered the same command multiple times, only the last command will be executed.
  e.g. if you specify `viewMeeting i/2viewMeeting i/2viewMeeting i/3`, only `viewMeeting i/3` will be taken.


* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `d/28092022 d/30092022`, only `d/30092022` will be taken.


* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `exit` and `help`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `exit 123`, it will be interpreted as `exit`.

</div>

### 7.1 Client commands

This subsection covers all client-related commands.

#### 7.1.1 Add client: `addClient`

Add a new client to _MyInsuRec_.

Format: `addClient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [b/BIRTHDAY] [pd/PRODUCT]`

* A client **must** have a `NAME` and a `PHONE_NUMBER`.
* `PHONE_NUMBER` should contain only numbers and be at least 8 digits long.
* `EMAIL`, `BIRTHDAY`, `ADDRESS` and `PRODUCT` are optional.
* If a `NAME` already exists in _MyInsuRec_, adding the same `NAME` will result in an error!

Use case:
1. You have just found a potential client! You can use this command to add their particulars into _MyInsuRec_ to help remember their contact information and other details.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">**:bulb: Tips and tricks:**
We are using `NAME` as a unique identifier because we have considered cases where parents will be using their contact details for their children. If you are stuck in a situation where both clients have the same name, you can add a few strings to make them unique, for example John Tan 1 and John Tan 2.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**:exclamation: Caution:**
In order to use `pd/PRODUCT` as a parameter, you must have already added that product into MyInsuRec via `addProduct`.
See [addProduct](#731-adding-a-product-addproduct).
</div>

Examples:
* Add a client named John Tan and his phone number
  * `addClient n/John Tan p/12345678`
* Same as above, but with his birthday this time
  * `addClient n/John Tan p/12345678 b/12122000`
* Same as above, but with even more details
  * `addClient n/John Tan p/12345678 e/johntan@insurec.com a/123 ABC ROAD, #11-01 pd/Product1`

#### 7.1.2 List clients: `listClient`

Shows the list of clients in MyInsuRec.

A valid filter can also be applied to show a selected list of clients.

Format: `listClient [pd/PRODUCT || b/BIRTHDAY]`

* A valid filter can be clients who have bought the product `PRODUCT` or clients whose birthday is in range `BIRTHDAY`.
* `BIRTHDAY` is specified by keywords. The possible keywords are:
  * `tomorrow` for a list of clients whose birthday is tomorrow;
  * `week` for a list of clients whose birthday is in the next week;
  * `month` for a list of clients whose birthday from the start of the respective month to the end of the respective month.

Use case:
1. You want to find out all your clients with upcoming birthdays so that you can prepare ahead and ensure that every client gets some birthday well wishes!
2. You want to identify the number of clients who purchased a particular product for analytics reasons.

Examples:
* List all clients
  * `listClient`
* List all clients who purchased Product1
  * `listClient pd/Product1`
* List all clients with their birthdays in the next week
  * `listClient b/week`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**:exclamation: Caution:** Both filters cannot exist simultaneously.
A user can only apply one filter at each time. For example, `listClient pd/Product1 b/week` is strictly not allowed.
</div>

#### 7.1.3 View client: `viewClient`

View details associated with a client, such as the client's name and phone number.

Format: `viewClient i/INDEX`

* Display information about the client at the specific `INDEX`.
* The `INDEX` refers to the index number shown by executing [`listClient`](#712-list-clients-listclient) command.
* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​

Use case:
1. View more specific details related to the client such as address and birthday which are not shown in the list of clients. This will help you foster a stronger relationship with your clients because you can wish them happy birthday!

Examples:
* View client with an `INDEX` of 1
  * `viewClient i/1`

Screenshot:
![ViewClient](images/features/ViewClient.png)

#### 7.1.4 Delete client: `delClient`

Delete the specified client from _MyInsuRec_.

Format: `delClient i/INDEX`

* Delete the client at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown by executing [`listClient`](#712-list-clients-listclient) command.
* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* If `INDEX` is a non-positive integer or not shown in `listClient`, an error will be shown!

Use case:
1. Suppose your client no longer requires your services and would like you to remove their personal information. You can use this command to remove their details from _MyInsuRec_.

Examples:
* Delete the client with an `INDEX` of 2
  * `delClient i/2`
* Delete the client with an `INDEX` of 6
  * `delClient i/6`

#### 7.1.5 Edit client: `editClient`

Edit details of the specified client.

Format: `editClient i/INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [b/BIRTHDAY] [pd/PRODUCT]`

* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one optional detail must be modified.
* Maintain value of details not edited by the command.
* If you wish to edit a client's `NAME` and the `NAME` already exists in _MyInsuRec_, it will result in an error!

Use case:
1. A client changed his address! Update the client details instead of having to removing the old record and creating a new record.

Examples:

Suppose MyInsuRec contains only one client 'John Tan' having phone number '0123456789':
* Change the name of this client to 'John Smith'
  * `editClient i/1 n/John Smith`
* Add email 'johntan@insurec.com'
  * `editClient i/1 e/johntan@insurec.com`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">**:bulb: Tips and tricks:**
We are using `NAME` as a unique identifier because we have considered cases where parents will be using their contact details for their children. If you are stuck in a situation where both clients have the same name, you can add a few strings to make them unique, for example John Tan 1 and John Tan 2.
</div>

### 7.2 Meeting commands

This subsection covers all meeting-related commands.

#### 7.2.1 Add meeting: `addMeeting`

Add a new meeting to MyInsuRec.

Format: `addMeeting i/INDEX d/DATE st/START_TIME et/END_TIME dn/DESCRIPTION`

* A meeting contains the `INDEX` of the client in the clients list, the `DATE` and `TIME` for the meeting, and the `DESCRIPTION` of the meeting.
* `INDEX` refers to the number of the client you are meeting with,
as shown by executing the [`listClient`](#712-list-clients-listclient) command.
* `DATE` should be given in the format DDMMYYYY. For example, 01022022 represents
1 February 2022.
* `START_TIME` and `END_TIME` should be give in the format HHMM. For example,
1234 represents the 12:34PM.

Use case:
1. You have just scheduled a meeting with a client! You can use this command to add the details of the meeting into _MyInsuRec_ to help remember the meeting details.

Examples:

Suppose MyInsuRec contains only one client 'Alex':
* Add a meeting with Alex on 28-Sep-2022 from 2PM to 3PM
  * `addMeeting i/1 d/28092022 st/1400 et/1500 dn/Alex's Policy Renewal`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">**:bulb: Tips and tricks:**
MyInsuRec can help you detect conflicting meeting times! For example, attempting to add a meeting from 1330 to 1430 when you already have one scheduled for 1300 to 1400 will display an error message.
</div>

#### 7.2.2 List meetings: `listMeeting`

Shows the list of meetings in MyInsuRec.

A valid filter can also be applied to show a selected list of meetings.

Format: `listMeeting [d/DATE]`

  * `month` for a list of meetings happening from the start of the respective month to the end of the respective month.

Use case:
1. Get an overview of all your upcoming meetings. This is especially useful for if you have a busy and packed schedule, and want to ease your mental load of having to recall all of your upcoming meetings!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-success">**:bulb: Tips and tricks:**
This command is used to get the index of a meeting. In order to perform commands related to a particular meeting such as `editMeeting`, you will have to first get its index by running `listMeeting`. So, expect to use this command a lot!
</div>

Examples:
* List all meetings
    * `listMeeting`
* List meetings happening in the next week
    * `listMeeting d/week`

#### 7.2.3 View meeting: `viewMeeting`

View details associated with a meeting, such as the meeting's date and time, as well as the client's details associated with the meeting.

Format: `viewMeeting i/INDEX`

* The `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …

Use Case:
1. Get an overview of the meeting and the client you are meeting with. This helps you become more prepared for the meeting, and you will not have to remember every single small detail of the meeting!

* If `INDEX` is a non-positive integer or not shown in `listMeeting`, an error will be shown!

Use case:
1. Remove a cancelled meeting.
2. Clean up any meetings that already happened. This helps to reduce clutter in _MyInsuRec_.

Examples:
* Delete meeting with an `INDEX` of 2
  * `delMeeting i/2`

#### 7.2.5 Edit meeting: `editMeeting`

Edit details of the specified meeting.

Format: `editMeeting i/INDEX [d/DATE] [st/START TIME] [et/END TIME] [dn/DESCRIPTION]`

  * `editMeeting i/1 dn/Follow up team meeting`

### 7.3 Product commands

1. Get an overview of all the products you are offering!
2. This feature is used to get the index of a product, which is needed for most product-related commands.

Examples:
* List all products
  * `listProduct`

#### 7.3.3 Delete product: `delProduct`

Delete a product from *MyInsuRec*.
This command removes this product from all the clients as well.

Format: `delProduct i/INDEX`

* Delete the product at the specified `INDEX`.
* `INDEX` refers to the index number shown by executing [`listProduct`](#732-list-products-listproduct) command.
* `INDEX` **must be a positive integer** 1, 2, 3, …
* If `INDEX` is a non-positive integer or not shown in `listProduct`, an error will be shown!

Use case:
1. If you no longer offer this product and no clients have purchased it before, you can remove it from *MyInsuRec* and prevent it from cluttering up *MyInsuRec*!

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">**:information_source: Note:**
This command is usually preceded by `listProduct`. This is because the product's index number `INDEX` is required to use this command, and `listProduct` shows a list of all the products with their index numbers.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**:exclamation: Caution:**
This feature should only be used if there is a need to delete a product, which is unlikely in most scenarios! Use with caution as this not only removes the product from MyInsuRec's product list, it also **removes the product from any association with your clients**.
</div>

Examples:
* Delete product with an `INDEX` of 2
    * `delProduct i/2`

### 7.4 General commands

#### 7.4.1 View help: `help`

Show a message explaining how to access the help page (this user guide!). 

You can click on 'Copy URL', then paste the link into your browser to get to the help page.  

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

#### 7.4.2 Exit MyInsuRec: `exit`

Exit the program.

Format: `exit`

#### 7.4.3 Clear *MyInsuRec*: `clear`

Clear all data in *MyInsuRec*.

Format: `clear`

Use Case:
1. *MyInsuRec* comes with default data to help you get started with using the application. But, you  may want to clear this data in order to add your own clients and meetings instead. So, this commands allows you to clear default data shipped with *MyInsuRec*.
2. Restarting the app from an empty version.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
This is a one-shot way of removing all data stored in *MyInsuRec*.
Only clear when you are sure you do not need the data anymore!
</div>

### 7.5 Others

#### 7.5.1 Save the data

MyInsuRec data are saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

#### 7.5.2 Edit the data file

MyInsuRec data are saved as a JSON file **[JAR file location]/data/myinsurec.json**. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**:exclamation: Caution:**
If your changes to the data file makes its format invalid, MyInsuRec will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">**:exclamation: Caution:**
Do not make any changes to the IDs (e.g., `"@UUID" : "3bbda97d-bae5-4f28-8ea0-0d0b39ee5a56"`) stored in the data file unless you are absolutely sure you know what you are doing!
</div>

#### 7.5.3 Change the color scheme

MyInsuRec comes with light and dark color schemes. To change between the two, simply click on the View menu button and select the desired mode!

![Dark Mode](images/DarkModeUi.png)

### 7.6 Proposed features

#### 7.6.1 Duplicate clients detection `[coming in v1.5]`

We plan to be able to detect duplicate clients entries in v1.5. For example, 'John Tan' and 'john tan' are likely to be the same person. As such, we plan to add a feature that warns the user when using such similar inputs. We also plan to distinguish between clients of similar names through this feature in v1.5, as such the current version v1.4 will disallow clients of the same names to be added.

## 8. FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another Computer?<br>
**A**: Install the app, then overwrite the **myinsurec.json** file created by the app with the version of the file from the previous computer. The **myinsurec.json** is located in **[JAR file location]/data/myinsurec.json**.

**Q**: Where is my data file located?<br>
**A**: The data file is located at `[JAR file location]/data/myinsurec.json`.

**Q**: I accidentally closed the app, will my data still be there?<br>
**A**: Yes, your data is saved automatically after every action.

**Q**: My computer does not recognise the file type jar. How do I open the app?<br>
**A**: Check if your computer already has Java 11 or above installed from [10.1 Checking your system's Java version](#101-checking-your-systems-java-version). If not, follow the instructions to install Java.

**Q**: Why can't I add a product to my client?<br>
**A**: First check that the product has been created use the [`listProduct`](#732-list-products-listproduct) command.
Create the product suing the [`addProduct`](#731-add-product-addproduct) command if it is not there.
Add the product to the client using the [`editClient`](#715-edit-client-editclient)  or [`addClient`](#711-add-client-addclient) command.

## 10. Troubleshooting

This section covers technical issues you may run into while using *MyInsuRec*.

### 10.1 Checking your system's Java version

To check that your system has the correct Java version (Java 11 and above) to run *MyInsuRec*, you can follow the steps below:

1. Open your terminal.
   * Windows
     * Use **Win** + **S** to open search.
     * Type in 'Terminal' to search for it and click on it to launch.
   * macOS
     * Use **Cmd** + **Space** to open Spotlight search.
     * Type in 'Terminal' to search for it and click on it to launch.
   * Linux
     * Use **Ctrl** + **Alt** + **T** to open the Terminal.
2. In your terminal, type in **java \-\-version** and click enter.
3. The following image shows an example what will show up in macOS, but you can expect a similar result in Windows.

![JavaVersionTroubleShoot](images/troubleshoot/JavaVersionTroubleShoot.png)

4. The number in the red highlight rectangle tells you the Java version installed. For example, the Java version installed on the example system is Java 11.0.16, which is sufficient to run *MyInsuRec* as it is greater than Java 11.

5. If you do not see a similar result in the terminal after Step 3, or have an earlier version of Java, head over to [Oracle's Java download page](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/downloads/) to install Java.
