Welcome to the CLInkedIn User Guide! 

CLInkedIn is a **desktop address book application made for Recruiting and Hiring Managers to keep track of candidates and their job applications.**

The application is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java [`11`](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `CLInkedIn.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-3/tp/releases).

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your `CLInkedIn` application.

4. Double-click the file to start the app. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`list`** : Lists all contacts.

   * **`add`**`n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 s/Application Received` : Adds a contact named `John Doe` to the Address Book.

   * **`delete`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd contact shown in the current list.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all contacts.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [st/SKILL_TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe st/Java` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[st/SKILL_TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `st/Java`, `st/Java st/Python` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

- Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

- The command word is case-insensitive.<br>
  e.g. `add` is the same as `ADD` or `aDd`.

</div>

## Viewing help : `help`

You can use this command to view a message explaining how to access the help page, as well as a list of commands and their descriptions.
Alternatively, you can obtain help on a specific command by typing `help` followed by the command name.

![help message](images/helpMessage.png)
Above is a screenshot of the help pop up window when the `help` command is input.

Format:

- `help` will open the help window in a separate window containing a list of commands and their usages.
- `help COMMAND` will display the command usage for COMMAND in the result display.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Warning:**
`help` will automatically parse any inputs given after the command word `help` as a command name. If the command name is invalid, an error message will be displayed in the result display.
</div>

Examples:

- `help` will open the help window.
- `help add` will display the usage of the `add` command.
- `help 123` will display an error message as `123` is not a valid command name.

* `edit 2 dt/Bachelors-Masters` edits the Degree tag `Bachelors` of the 2nd person to be `Masters`.
* `edit 3 n/PersonA n/PersonB` edits the name of the 3rd person first to `PersonA` and then to `PersonB`. Hence the final name of 3rd person is set to `PersonB`.
* `edit 2 l/https://github.com/JohnDoe l/https://instagram.com/JohnDoe` edits by replacing all existing links with the provided links.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**>

* While editing the **Skill** tags, you can rename the existing `OLD_SKILL` of the person to `NEW_SKILL` provided the Skill Tag Type has not been deleted (Same for **Degree**, **JobType** and **Custom** tags).<br>
* While editing the **Notes** of a person, their existing notes will be overwritten by the new input. Therefore, it is not possible to edit individual notes (i.e. if you input `edit 1 note/Good at Java` and the person already has a note `Good at Python`, the person's note(s) will be changed to `Good at Java`).<br>
* While editing the **Links** of a person, their existing links will be overwritten by the new input. Therefore, it is not possible to edit individual links (i.e. if you input `edit 1 l/https://github.com/JohnDoe` and the person already has a link `https://instagram.com/JohnDoe`, the person's link(s) will be changed to `https://github.com/JohnDoe`).

</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**

* Any keywords after the command will be searched for in the personal information and tags of all candidates.

**`find` by prefix:**

* Prefixes are used to specify which fields to search for the keywords in.

Format: `find KEYWORD [MORE_KEYWORDS]` or `find [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [s/STATUS] [rate/RATING] [MORE_TAGGED_KEYWORDS]...`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note**
- The search is case-insensitive. e.g `hans` will match `Hans`
- The order of the keywords does not matter. e.g. `Hans Bo` will match `Bo Hans`
- The personal information and tags will be searched.
- Partial words will be matched e.g. `Han` will match `Hans`
- Persons matching at least one keyword will be returned (i.e. `OR` search).
- Search can be further refined by specifying the type of tag to search for.
  
</div>

Examples:
- `find John` returns `john` and `John Doe`
- `find Java` returns list of candidates with Java skills
- `find Hans Bo` will return `Hans Gruber`, `Bo Yang`
- `find alex david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
- `find n/John` returns `John Doe`
- `find n/alex n/david` returns `Alex Yeoh`, `David Li`
- `find s/application pending` returns list of candidates with status `application pending`
- `find n/John p/867` returns `John Doe` with phone number `8675309`

### Viewing Statistics based on ratings of candidates: `stats`

Views rating statistics of the candidates currently saved in CLInkedIn.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Note:**
Only shows statistics of candidates in the current filtered list. 

- If the find command is used and only 5 candidates are shown,
then only the statistics of these 5 candidates will be shown when stats is used.
</div>

Format: `stats`

Example:
* `stats` displays the rating statistics of the candidates in the current filtered list.

### Exporting the data in CLInkedIn: `export`

Exports the data for the displayed list of candidates to the specified location in the specified format. 

Format: `export path/PATH_WITH_NAME_OF_FILE_TO_BE_EXPORTED_TO`
* The path specified must be an absolute path.
* The format of the file must be JSON or CSV.
* Any directory in the path which does not exist will automatically be created.
* Only the displayed list of candidates will be exported.

Examples:
* `export path//Desktop/sample/data.csv` exports the displayed list of candidates to `data.csv` in the `sample` directory of the `Desktop` (Sample path for MACOS).
* `export path/C:\Users\John\Desktop\data.json` exports the displayed list of candidates to `data.json` in the `Desktop` (Sample path for WINDOWS).

* The format of the file must be JSON or CSV.
* The data being imported will be merged with the existing data in CLInkedIn.
* Candidates whose name already exists in CLInkedIn will be ignored.

Examples:
* `import path//Desktop/sample/data.csv` imports the list of candidates from `data.csv` in the `sample` directory of the `Desktop` to the address book (Sample path for MACOS).
* `import path/C:\Users\John\Desktop\data.json` imports the list of candidates from `data.json` in the `Desktop` to the address book (Sample path for WINDOWS).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
