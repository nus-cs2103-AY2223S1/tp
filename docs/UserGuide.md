## **1. Introduction**

### 1.1 What is HobbyList?
HobbyList is a **desktop app for students to manage their hobby activities, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HobbyList can get your activity management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

If you prefer typing only and want to record your experiences with your hobby activities such as reading books or watching movies, HobbyList is the perfect app for you.

## **5. Features**
<a name="command-info"></a>
<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/42km run`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG] [date/DATE] [s/STATUS] ` can be used as `n/42km run t/sport` or as `n/42km run`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/sport`, `t/sport t/cardio` etc.

* A parameter is something you add after the command name to provide more information to the command.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `d/NUS Run d/NUS Biathlon`, only `d/NUS Biathlon` will be taken.

* The date format for `[date/DATE]` should be `yyyy-mm-dd`. e.g. `date/2022-12-25`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
