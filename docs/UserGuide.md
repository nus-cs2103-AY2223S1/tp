## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [h/HOMEWORK]` can be used as `n/John Doe h/math` or as `n/John Doe`.
* Items with `…` after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/Tag]…` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/Math`, `t/Math t/Science` etc.
* Parameters with prefixes can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.
* Index has to be supplied according to format given.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `hw INDEX h/HOMEWORK`, `hw h/HOMEWORK INDEX` is not allowed.
* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.
* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
