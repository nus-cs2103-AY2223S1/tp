## Tutorial for Beginners

If you are a beginner to Waddle, this tutorial will walk you through creating and planning your very first Waddle itinerary.


This is the [home page](#the-home-page), which you will encounter when you open Waddle. 
It displays all your current itineraries. 
The various sections of the interface have been labeled in blue for your reference.
If this is your first time launching Waddle, you will see the following page with two sample itineraries:<br> <br>
![home-page-sample-ui](images/ug-beg-tut/main-page-sample-ui.png)

If you wish to, you can [clear](#clearing-itineraries--clear) the sample itineraries by typing `clear` into the command box and pressing Enter.
You will then see the below message:<br> <br>
![clear-command](images/clear.png)

Now you can add your first itinerary. To do so, use the [`add` command](#creating-a-new-itinerary--add) with the relevant itinerary details.
Try executing the command `add d/Summer Trip sd/2023-06-01 du/5`. 
It will add an itinerary named Summer Trip, starting from 1 June 2023 with a duration of 5 days.
You should now see the message below and your itinerary added on the home page as follows:<br> <br>
![add-itinerary](images/ug-beg-tut/add-itinerary.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* You can replace the `add` command inputs with the relevant details of your itinerary.
* You can include optional details such as the country, number of people, and budget.
  - e.g. Enter `add d/Summer Trip c/Japan sd/2023-06-01 du/5 p/4 b/2000` instead to specify the country as Japan, number of people as 4, and your budget as $2000. 
* For additional information, refer to the [`add` command](#creating-a-new-itinerary--add)  in the [Features](#features) section under home page commands.

</div>

Select the itinerary which you have just created by typing in `select` along with the index of the itinerary on the list, then press Enter.
For example, if "Summer Trip" is shown as the first itinerary on the list, enter `select 1`.
You will now see the planning page for the itinerary as follows:<br><br>
![planning-page-ui](images/ug-beg-tut/planning-page-ui.png)

You can return to the main page anytime you wish by executing `home`.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note about commands:**<br>

* Note that the commands for the main page are different from those for an itinerary planning page.
  Some commands only apply to one type of page while some are universally applicable (i.e. they can be executed on any page).
* To find out more about which commands apply to your current page, visit the user guide's [Features](#features) section.

</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always"></div>


To add an activity to your Wishlist, use the [`add` command](#adding-an-activity--add).
Try adding a new activity by typing in `add d/Visit Meiji Shrine du/120` to the command box and press Enter.
This will add a new activity with the description of "Visit Meiji Shrine" and a duration of 120 minutes.
You should now see the activity being displayed in the Wishlist.<br><br>
![add-item](images/ug-beg-tut/add-item.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>

* You can replace the `add` command inputs with the relevant details of your activities.
* You can include optional details such as the priority and cost.
  - e.g. Enter `add d/Visit Meiji Shrine du/120 p/5 c/20` instead to specify the priority as 5 and the cost as $20.
* For additional information, refer to the [`add` command](#adding-an-activity--add) explanation in the [Features](#features) section under itinerary planning page commands.

</div>

Try adding a few more activities! You should see the activities listed in the Wishlist.

To schedule an item from your Wishlist on a specific day in your itinerary, use the [`plan` command](#scheduling-an-activity--plan).
For example, type `plan 1 d/1 st/10:00` into the command box and Enter.
Waddle will schedule the first item on your Wishlist for Day 1 of your itinerary starting at 10am.
You should see the item being moved from the Wishlist section to the Day 1 item list, as follows:<br><br>
![plan-item](images/ug-beg-tut/plan-item.png)

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes:**<br>
   
* For additional information, refer to the [`plan` command](#scheduling-an-activity--plan) explanation in the [Features](#features) section under itinerary planning page commands.

</div>

Note that the index of the activity is now shown as 1.1, meaning it is the first activity on Day 1.

Now you can try scheduling all the activities in your Wishlist!

Once you are satisfied with your schedule, you can export your schedule as a PDF document using the [`pdf` command](#exporting-as-pdf-file--pdf).
Type `pdf` into the command box and Enter.
You should now see the below: <br> <br>
![pdf](images/ug-beg-tut/pdf.png)

Navigate to your computer's Documents folder, where you should see a folder named Waddle. 
Open up the folder to see a PDF document with the same name as your exported itinerary.
You can open the PDF document to view your itinerary schedule.

You can easily send your itinerary details to others using the [`copy` command](#copying-to-clipboard--copy).
Type `copy` into the command box and Enter. 
This will copy your itinerary to your clipboard, and you can now paste it in another location such as a messaging or email application.
You should also see the below displayed in Waddle: <br> <br>
![copy](images/ug-beg-tut/copy.png)

Congratulations! You have now created and planned your very first travel itinerary using Waddle.
We hope this tutorial has helped you kickstart your journey!

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  - e.g. in `add d/DESCRIPTION ...`, `DESCRIPTION` is a parameter which can be used as `add d/My Japan Trip`.
   
* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  - e.g. if the command specifies `c/COUNTRY d/DESCRIPTION`, `d/DESCRIPTION c/COUNTRY` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the **last occurrence** of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  - e.g. if you specify `d/Eat Ramen d/Aquarium`, only `d/Aquarium` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  - e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

### The activity-planning page

Once you have created your itinerary, you can now start adding and planning the activities that you want to complete in
your time there! The activity-planning page of an itinerary displays the list of activities that you have added to your
itinerary. Activities on the wishlist that you have not given a start time and date yet will appear at the very top,
in order of _priority_ (as indicated by the number of stars). Activities that you have scheduled will instead appear in
the list of days below the wishlist, sorted by _start time_.

The index of scheduled activities are in the format `DAY.ACTIVITY_NUMBER`. Some examples:
* The _first_ activity of the _first_ day will have index `1.1`
* The _fifth_ activity of the _third_ day will have index `3.5`
* The _second_ activity of the wishlist will have index `2`

Here's an example of how your activity-planning page might look like:

### Commands on the activity-planning page

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

  - Examples of invalid input: `c/1,000,000`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Note:**<br>
