DevEnable is a **desktop app for developers to manager their projects, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, DevEnable can get your project management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

2. Download the latest `devenable.jar`.

3. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for DevEnable.

4. Double-click the file to start the app.

5. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`project -l`** : Lists all projects.

   * **`project -a`**`n/Orbital` : Adds a project named `Orbital` to the project list.

   * **`project -d`**`3` : Deletes the project with project id `3`.

   * **`clear`** : Deletes all data from all lists.

6. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `project -a n/PROJECT_NAME`, `PROJECT_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `project -a n/PROJECT_NAME`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/PROJECT_NAME [r/REPOSITORY]` can be used as `project -a n/ProjectY r/AgentX/ProjectY` or
  `project -a n/ProjectY`.

* Commands are in the following format: `COMMAND FLAG [ID/ARGUMENTS]`. Every command starts with a command keyword,
  followed by the command flag, then the arguments for said command. Typically, flags start with a dash `-`, and
  arguments start with an identifier `ID/ARGUMENT`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `client -a p/PROJECT_ID n/CLIENT_NAME [m/CLIENT_MOBILE] [e/CLIENT_EMAIL]`, 
  `client -a p/PROJECT_ID n/CLIENT_NAME [e/CLIENT_EMAIL] [m/CLIENT_MOBILE]` are both acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command, but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence
  of the parameter will be taken. (Does not apply for Find and Sort Commands) <br>
  e.g. if you specify `m/12341234 m/56785678`, only `m/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Trailing extraneous input for commands that take in parameters will be considered a part of the last valid 
  argument identifier unless the argument identifier takes in an index parameter .
  e.g. if the command specifies `project -e n/New Project x/this is extra`, `New Project x/this is extra` will be 
  taken as the argument for `n/` but if the command specifies `project -e n/New Project p/2 x/this is extra`, then 
  only `2` will be taken as the argument for `p/`.
