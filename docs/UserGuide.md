Salesy is an all-in-one tool for NUS canteen vendors who want to keep track of their tasks, inventory and suppliers. 
With Salesy, you can expect a good visualization of your inventory and increased efficiency of your bookkeeping routines.
Salesy is optimized for use via a [Command Line Interface](#62-command-line-interface-cli) (CLI) while still having the benefits of 
a [Graphical User Interface](#63-graphical-user-interface-gui) (GUI).

# 6. Appendix

## 6.1 Colors used in the Inventory

**Detailed Explanation**

| Color          | Meaning                                                      | How is it determined ?                                                                              |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| 🔴&nbsp;Red    | Running `low`, restock as soon as possible.                  | **Less than 120%** of minimum stock specified.                                                      |
| 🟠&nbsp;Orange | Running at a `moderate` level, can consider restocking soon. | **More than and equal to 120%** of minimum stock specified and **less than 165%** of minimum stock. |
| 🟢&nbsp;Green  | Running at a `healthy` level, no worries about restocking.   | **More than and equal to 165%** of minimum stock specified.                                         |

### More details

**What is _minimum stock_?**
* Minimum stock refers the minimum amount of stock in which the canteen vendor feel is required for
daily operations.
* The minimum stock is a parameter supplied by the user when using the [`addItem`](#41-add-suppliertasksupply-item-add) command.
* Current stock refers to the amount of stock the canteen vendor current have in the inventory.

**Example on how the colours are determined:**

Context: a user wants to keep track of the amount of eggs in its inventory.

For example, the minimum stock required for daily operation is `100`.

When it shows **green** colour: Our current stock is **More than and equal to `165%`** of minimum stock specified.

1. For this case, `165%` of `100` eggs is `165` eggs.
2. If our current stock has `165` eggs and above it will display green.

When it shows **yellow** colour: Our current stock must be **More than and equal to `120%`** of minimum stock specified 
and **less than `165%`** of minimum stock specified.

1. For this case, `120%` of `100` eggs is `120` eggs and `165%` if `100` eggs `165` eggs.
2. If our current stock is between `120` eggs inclusive and `165` eggs exclusive it will display yellow.

When it shows **red** colour: Our current stock must be **Less than `120%`** of minimum stock specified.

1. For this case, `120%` of `100` eggs is `120` eggs.
2. If our current stock is less than `120` eggs it will display red.

## 6.2 Command Line Interface (CLI)

* CLI is a medium or a platform, where a user writes a command to answer a visual prompt and then receives a response from the system/device.
* In the case of Salesy, the CLI is used heavily to allow the user to perform commands.

## 6.3 Graphical User Interface (GUI)

* In a GUI, you get various menus for making things easy, such as buttons, windows, scrollbars etc. It is very intuitive yet simple to use, even for a newbie.
* In the case of Salesy, we utilize the GUI to give the user a visual view of their commands done from the CLI.
