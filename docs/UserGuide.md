--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Quick start

1. Ensure you have Java `11` or above installed in your Computer.

1. Download the latest `FoodWhere.jar` from [here](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/releases).

1. Copy the file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for your application.

1. On Windows and Mac, double-click the file to start the app. The application can also be started by running `java -jar FoodWhere.jar` in the terminal. The GUI similar to the below should appear in a few seconds. Note how the app contains some sample data.<br>
   ![Ui](images/Ui.png)

1. Type the command in the command box and press Enter to execute it. e.g. typing **`help`** and pressing Enter will open the help window.<br>
   Some example commands you can try:

   * **`slist`** : Lists all food stalls.

   * **`sadd`**`n/John Doe Eatery a/Blk 123 Bedok South t/halal`: Adds a food stall named John Doe Eatery to
     the list of food stalls.

   * **`sdel`**`3` : Deletes the 3rd food stall shown in the current list.

   * **`exit`** : Exits the app.

1. Refer to the [Features](#features) below for details of each command.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `sadd n/NAME a/ADDRESS`, `NAME` and `ADDRESS` are parameters which can be used as `sadd n/John Doe Eatery a/ABC Ave`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAGS]` can be used as `n/John Doe Eatery t/opendaily` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAGS]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/opendaily`, `t/petfriendly` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME a/ADDRESS`, `a/ADDRESS n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken unless specified otherwise.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/John Doe Eatery n/Jane Doe Eatery`, only `n/Jane Doe Eatery` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `slist`, `rlist`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that take in parameters (such as `sadd`, `rdel`, `sedit` and `rsort`) will be interpreted as part of the command preamble if there are no parameters specified before it, and part of the previous parameter otherwise.<br>
  e.g. a command `ssort name n/Eatery` fails as the preamble is interpreted to be `name n/Eatery`, which is not a valid criterion.<br>
  e.g. a command `sadd n/Finnish Delights p/Alex Jones a/Blk 23 North View Road` fails as the name is interpreted to be `Finnish Delights p/Alex Jones`, which is not a valid name as it contains a slash.

* Not all mistakes may be reported for an invalid command.<br>
  e.g. given an invalid command `sadd`, the user would be informed of one of the mistakes, in this case, missing name or missing address. There is no guarantee which mistake will be reported if multiple mistakes are present.

### Clearing all entries: `clear`

Clears FoodWhere by removing all stalls and the associated reviews.

Format: `clear`

### Exiting the program: `exit`

Exits the program.

Format: `exit`

### Duplicate checking

FoodWhere checks for duplicates to a limited extent.
* Since food stalls may have generic names, stall duplicates are checked via name and address, that is if both the names and address are the same (case-insensitive).
  * e.g. The food stall named "PartyOuting" at address "North Street" and the food stall named "PartYouTing" at address "north street" are the same stall.
  * e.g. The food stall named "Mixed Veg Rice" at address "North Street" and the food stall named "Mixed Veg Rice" at address "South Street" are different stalls.
* Reviews are considered duplicates if they are on the same stall and have the same content (case-sensitive), rating, date and set of tags.

### Saving the data

FoodWhere data is saved in the hard disk automatically after any command that changes the data. There is no need to save manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
If there are no commands entered, simply exiting the program will not generate a new JSON file if the file is not present.
</div>

### Editing the data file

FoodWhere data are saved as a JSON file `[JAR file location]/data/foodwhere.json`. Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing that data file while FoodWhere is closed. The allowed format for the data file is outlined in the [Developer Guide](DeveloperGuide.md#).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Should FoodWhere be unable to interpret the data file, FoodWhere will start with no data. Close FoodWhere without using the `exit` command to avoid overwriting the data file.
</div>

## FAQ

**Q**: How do I transfer my data to another computer?<br>
**A**: Install and run the app on the other computer. Overwrite the data file it creates with the `foodwhere.json` file that contains the data of your previous FoodWhere application.

**Q**: How do I backup my data?<br>
**A**: Backup the `foodwhere.json` file in another directory.

## Future features (unimplemented)

Attempt to use the following features could result in user confusion, an error message or accidentally typing in an unexpected valid command.

* Copying stall/review data using commands to allow them to be pasted in an external application.
  * This would need to be handled for each field, which would need significant additional effort.
* Showing reviews/stalls that match more of the `sfind`/`rfind` search terms first
* Finding reviews by rating
* Finding reviews/stalls by address
* A second window that gives more space for long text to be viewed completely
* Undo previous command
* Smarter error detection which detects the first error a user makes in a command
* Clearing all reviews only
