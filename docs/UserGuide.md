## **Using this guide**

This user guide contains all the information that you will need to know as a user of **RC4HDB**. We hope that it
will serve you well in mastering RC4HDB!

If you are a **new user**, the necessary knowledge for you to get started can be found [here](#quick-start).
As you read on, you will find plenty of examples to help you familiarise with the features.

If you are an **experienced user**, a [command summary](#command-summary) is also provided, so you don't have to memorise our commands.

Before exploring the user guide, you should familiarise yourself with the following symbols.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Used to highlight information you should
pay attention to. </div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** used to highlight tips. </div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:** used to highlight dangers. </div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Quick start**

Here is a quick guide on how to get a working copy of RC4HDB on your computer.

#### 1. Setup

Ensure you have [*Java 11*](https://www.oracle.com/sg/java/technologies/javase/jdk11-archive-downloads.html) or
above installed on your Computer.

#### 2. Install

Visit this [link](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-3/tp/releases/). Click on `rc4hdb.jar` to download the latest `rc4hdb.jar`. Move the `rc4hdb.jar` file to the folder you want to use as the _home folder_ for RC4HDB. The home folder is the folder from which the application will run, save data to, and retrieve data from.

#### 3. Running RC4HDB

Double-click the file to start the app. The **Graphical User Interface (GUI)** similar to the one shown
below should appear in a few seconds.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
You may have noticed that upon double-clicking `rc4hdb.jar` for the first time, several files were created. **Do not
delete the folder called `data` as this would cause all your data to be deleted!**
</div>

<br>

![Ui](images/Ui.png)

#### 4. Try it out!

Try typing `help` into the command box where it says "Enter Command here..." and pressing the Enter/Return key on your keyboard to execute it! This command will open a help window which shows you a quick summary of our available commands.

For more details on commands, refer to our [command guide](#command-guide) below.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Command Guide**

Below shows a breakdown of how the commands in **RC4HDB** are structured. Don't be afraid that you
may have typed a command incorrectly as **RC4HDB** will inform you in the event that this happens!

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are compulsory parameters and must be entered by you.<br>
  Parameters are texts you enter to tell **RC4HDB** the information necessary for the command to work.

  e.g. when using the `add` command, `NAME` is a parameter which you must enter. Thus, the command format is as such:`add n/NAME`. To add a resident named "John Doe", you can then enter `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g. `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times. This also includes 0 times.<br>
  e.g. `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken,
  unless otherwise specified.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Irrelevant parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.

## **Getting Help**

Viewing the command summary from the user guide can be a hassle to some. As an alternative, we have incorporated it
directly into **RC4HDB**.

### Viewing help : `help`

Opens a window with a summary table of all commands, and examples of its usage.
A link to this user guide is also included for your convenience.

<!---
![help message](images/helpMessage.png)

Format: `help`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:** You can press the `F1` key on your keyboard to
open the Help Window immediately! You can also press the `Esc` key on your keyboard to close the Help Window
if it is open. </div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Modifying Resident Data**

In order to maintain the database, we have provided several **basic commands** such as `add`, `edit`, `delete` and `clear`
to help you modify resident data within RC4HDB.

Note:
* RC4HDB **does not allow duplicate residents** to exist within the database, as a measure to prevent unintentional adding of duplicate residents.
* Two residents are considered duplicates of each other if any of the following are same:
  * Matriculation number
  * Phone number
  * Email
  * Room

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
Before proceeding to learn more about resident commands it would be good to have a quick read about the **resident fields**, which will
be used in the commands. The resident <a>[fields](#glossary-of-terms)</a> can be found <a>[here](#format-for-resident-fields)</a>.
</div>

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Adding a resident : `add`

Adds a resident. Does **not** allow any [duplicate residents](#modifying-resident-data) to be added.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL r/FLOOR-UNIT g/GENDER h/HOUSE m/MATRIC_NUMBER [t/TAG]…​`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
A resident can have any number of tags (including 0).
</div>

Examples:
* `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnDoe@gmail.com r/5-1 g/M h/D m/A9876543B` adds a resident named John Doe, with
  relevant personal and student information.
* `add n/Betsy Crowe t/friend e/betsycrowe@example.com r/2-3 p/12345678 m/A3456789B g/F h/A` adds a resident named
  Betsy Crowe, with relevant personal and student information.

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Editing an existing resident : `edit`

Edits the data of an existing resident. Does **not** allow any [duplicate residents](#modifying-resident-data) to be created due to the editing of a resident.

Format: `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [e/EMAIL] [r/FLOOR-UNIT] [g/GENDER] [h/HOUSE] [m/MATRIC_NUMBER] [t/TAG]…​`
* Edits the resident at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed residents list.
* The index **must be a positive integer:** 1, 2, 3, …​
* At least one of the optional parameters must be provided.
* Existing values will be updated to the input values.
* When editing tags, the existing tags of the resident will be removed i.e adding of tags is not cumulative.
* You can remove all the resident’s tags by typing `t/` without specifying any tags after it.

Examples:
*  `edit 1 p/91234567 r/5-8` Edits the phone number, room number of the 1st resident to be `91234567`, and `5-8`
   respectively.
*  `edit 2 n/Betsy Crower t/` Edits the name of the 2nd resident to be `Betsy Crower` and clears all existing tags.

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Deleting a resident : `delete`

Deletes the specified resident.

Format: `delete INDEX`
* Deletes the resident at the specified `INDEX`.
* The index refers to the index number shown in the displayed resident list.
* The index **must be a positive integer:** 1, 2, 3, …​

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-primary">:bulb: **Tip:**
The delete command can be used in conjunction with other commands such as list and find, to delete residents in different types of filtered lists.
</div>

Examples:
* `list` followed by `delete 2` deletes the 2nd resident in the database.
* `find Betsy` followed by `delete 1` deletes the 1st resident in the results of the `find` command.

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Deleting multiple residents : `remove`

Deletes residents whose fields match the input keywords.

Format: `remove /SPECIFIER KEY/VALUE [ADDITIONAL_KEYS/ADDITIONAL_VALUES]`
* A specifier is required in order for the command to work. If not, it is an invalid command format.
* Currently, only two specifiers are supported:
  * `/all` returns a resident if it fulfills **all** of the specified keywords.
  * `/any` returns a resident if it fulfills **any** of the specified keywords.
* Repeated keys are not permitted for both specifiers, e.g. `remove /all h/D h/A` will not work.
* However, tags can be repeated in the command e.g. `remove /all t/exchange t/fresher`.
* Valid keys are those included [here](#format-for-resident-fields), and any additional tags.

Examples:
* `remove /all h/D g/M` deletes residents who are in `Draco` house, **and** are Male.
* `remove /any h/D h/A` deletes residents belonging to either `Draco` **or** `Aquila` house.

### Clearing all entries : `clear`

Clears all entries from **RC4HDB**.

Format: `clear`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-warning">:exclamation: **Caution:**
Deleted data can not be retrieved. Do use this command cautiously!
</div>

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Format for resident fields

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Viewing Residents**

You might find yourself overloaded with information. These commands can help you hide resident fields from view, 
find specific residents, or search for residents whose fields match a specific keyword. By de-cluttering your screen, 
these commands help you to focus only on the information you need!

### Listing all residents : `list`

Lists *all* the residents in the **RC4HDB** database with *all* fields included in the view. If the table view is showing a [filtered portion](#filtering-residents-by-field--filter) of the residents,
calling `list` will restore and display the full list of residents.

Format: `list`
* Any input entered directly after `list` will be ignored. i.e. *`list asd`*, `asd` will be ignored.
* Resets the columns in the table to the default view with *all* columns visible.

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Showing only some columns : `showonly`

Shows only the specified columns from the *current* table view.

[comment]: <> (If your screen is too cluttered, you may use this command to show only the columns you need!)

Note:

1. You can only use `showonly` on existing columns in the current table view, and
2. The `showonly` command does not modify the list of residents being displayed. [Filtered residents](#filtering-residents-by-field--filter) *stay filtered*.

Format: `showonly LETTER [MORE_LETTERS]`
* Valid inputs include `i n p e r g h m t` (case-insensitive), which correspond to the first letter of each field in the table.
    * This *should not* be confused with the `n/` or `p/` prefixes used in `add` or `filter`.
* Letters *must* be separated by a single whitespace.
* The order of each letter does not matter.
* Duplicate letters are ignored.
* There needs to be at least one column shown in the table at all times.
* You can always use `reset` to restore the full table view!

Calling `filter /all g/M` on a full table, followed by `showonly n g h` will produce the following result:

![showonly](images/ug-photos/showonly_photo.png)

As you can see,`showonly` displays only the specified columns, and does not change the filtered list of residents. 

The following examples are to be performed one after the other:

1. `showonly n g h` on a full table returns a table with only the *name*, *gender* and *house* columns shown, as above.
2. Using `showonly r p e` on the table from point 1 is **invalid** as the *room*, *phone* and
  *email* columns are *not present* in the current table.
3. However, using `showonly n g` on said table is **valid**, and will return a table with only the *name* and
  *gender* columns shown.

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Hiding only some columns : `hideonly`

Hides only the specified columns from the *current* table view.

[comment]: <> (Use `hideonly` if there are more columns to show than hide.)

Note:

1. You can only use `hideonly` on existing columns in the current table view, and
2. The `hideonly` command does not modify the list of residents being displayed. Residents found using `find` *stay displayed* in the table. 

(Click [here](#locating-residents-by-name--find) to learn about `find`)

Format: `hideonly LETTER [MORE_LETTERS]`
* Valid inputs include `i n p e r g h m t` (case-insensitive), which correspond to the first letter of each field in the table.
    * This *should not* be confused with the `n/` or `p/` prefixes used in `edit` or `filter`.
* Letters *must* be separated by a single whitespace.
* The order of each letter does not matter.
* Duplicate letters are ignored.
* There needs to be at least one column shown in the table at all times.
* You can always use `reset` to restore the full table view!

Calling `hideonly i r p e m t` on a full table will produce the following result:

![hideonly](images/ug-photos/hideonly_photo.png)

The following examples are to be performed one after the other:

1. `hideonly i r p e m t` on a full table returns a table with only the *index*, *room*, *phone*, *email*, *matric* 
   and *tags* columns hidden. 
   * In other words, we see a table with only the *name*, *gender* and *house* columns shown, as above.
2. Using `hideonly r e` on the table from point 1 is **invalid** as the *room* and *email* columns *are not
   present* in the current table.
3. However, using `hideonly n` on said table is **valid**, and will return a table with only the *gender* and *house*
   columns shown, as the *name* column has been hidden.

Note:
* Valid inputs include `i n p e r g h m t` (case-insensitive), which correspond to the first letter of each field in the table.
    * This *should not* be confused with the `n/` or `p/` prefixes used in `edit` or `filter`.
* Letters *must* be separated by a single whitespace.
* The order of each letter does not matter.
* Duplicate letters are ignored.
* There needs to be at least one column shown in the table at all times.
* You can always use `reset` to restore the full table view!

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Resetting hidden columns : `reset`

Resets the columns in the table to the full view with *all* columns visible.

[comment]: <> (Use this when you have called `showonly` or `hideonly` on the table!)

Format: `reset`
* Any input entered directly after `reset` will be ignored. i.e. *`reset asd`*, `asd` will be ignored.
* This command is different from the `list` command in that it does not affect the list of residents being displayed.
    * However, both commands cause the full set of resident fields (i.e. the full set of columns) to be displayed in the table.

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Locating residents by name : `find`

Finds residents whose names contain any of the given keywords.

Format: `find KEYWORD [ADDITIONAL_NAMES]`
* The search is case-insensitive. e.g `peter pang` will match `Peter Pang`.
* Only the name is searched.
* The order of the keywords does not matter.
* Full and partial words will be matched e.g. `Nav` will match `Navarun`.
* Residents matching at least one keyword will be returned, e.g. `Quek Wei` will return `Quek Xiang`, `Jun Wei`.

Calling `find el an` on our sample data will produce the following result:

![find_command](images/ug-photos/find_photo.png)

As you can see, the residents with names containing either "el" or "an" are listed as the result of the `find` command.

Examples:
* `find shawn` returns `Shawn Lee` and `Shawn Ng`
* `find elizabeth david` returns `Elizabeth Ong`, `David Lee`
* `find char li` returns `Charmaine Yee`, `William Li`<br>

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Filtering residents by field : `filter`

Shows a list of residents whose fields match the input keywords.

Format: `filter /SPECIFIER KEY/VALUE [ADDITIONAL_KEYS/ADDITIONAL_VALUES]`
* A specifier is required in order for the command to work. If not, it is an invalid command format.
* Only one specifier can be entered in a command.
* Currently, only two specifiers are supported:
  * `/all` returns a resident if it fulfills **all** of the specified keywords.
  * `/any` returns a resident if it fulfills **any** of the specified keywords.
* Repeated keys are not permitted for both specifiers, e.g. `filter /all h/D h/A` will not work.
* Tags can be repeated in the command e.g. `filter /all t/exhange t/fresher`.
* Valid keys are those included [here](#format-for-resident-fields), and any additional tags.

Examples:
* `filter /all h/D g/M` returns residents who are in `Draco` house, **and** are Male.
* `filter /any h/D h/A` returns residents belonging to either `Draco` **or** `Aquila` house.
* `filter g/M` returns residents who are male.

## **File Management**

To provide a streamlined way of managing **RC4** related data, **RC4HDB** provides users with the ability to organise their files using our file management commands.

**RC4HDB** currently supports the following file management functionalities:
* [**Creation**](#creating-a-new-data-folder--file-create) of new data folders.
* [**Deletion**](#deleting-an-existing-data-folder--file-delete) of old data folders.
* [**Switching**](#switching-to-a-different-data-folder--file-switch) between different data folders.
* [**Importing**](#importing-resident-data-from-csv-file--file-import) of resident data from a [CSV](#glossary-of-terms) file.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
Before proceeding to learn more about file commands it would be good to have a quick read about the **file command format** and **CSV files**, which will be used in the commands. They can be found <a>[here](#file-command-format)</a> and
<a>[here](#csv-file-format)</a> respectively.
</div>

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding your data

**RC4HDB** stores your data in a **main** data folder named `data`, which can be found in the same folder where you placed the `rc4hdb.jar` file. Within the **main** data folder, resident and venue data is stored in **sub** data folder(s). The default data folder that all copies of **RC4HDB** start out with is the `rc4hdb` folder.

Inside your data folder, there should be two [JSON](#glossary-of-terms) files, `resident_data.json` and `venue_data.json`, which store your **resident** and **venue** data respectively.

To find out which **sub** data folder is currently open, look at the **footer**, that can be found at the bottom of the application interface as shown in the image below, where the current **sub** data folder that is open is `rc4hdb`.

![Current data folder footer](images/ug-photos/current_data_folder_footer.png)

### Saving your data

RC4HDB saves your data after every command. There is no need to save manually.

[Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Creating a new data folder : `file create`

Creates a new [**sub**](#finding-your-data) folder with `FOLDER_NAME` as its name.

Format: `file create FOLDER_NAME`
* Does not create a new folder if the folder already exists.
* After creating a new folder, RC4HDB will then create **fresh** data file to store **venue** and **resident** data.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The **FOLDER_NAME** must follow this <a>[format](#file-command-format)</a>. </div>

Examples:
* `file create rc4_data_2022` will create a new folder named `rc4_data_2022` with fresh data **resident** and **venue** data files.

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

### Deleting an existing data folder : `file delete`

### Importing resident data from CSV file : `file import`

Imports data from [CSV](#glossary-of-terms) files. In order for RC4HDB to find your files, place them in the [**main**](#finding-your-data) data folder.

Format: `file import FILE_NAME`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
The **FILE_NAME** must follow this <a>[format](#file-command-format)</a> and the **CSV** file must follow this <a>[format](#csv-file-format)</a>.
</div>

Examples:
* `file import residents` will import the data from `residents.csv` into a new **resident** data file which can be found in the `residents` **sub** data folder in the **main** data folder.

[↑ Back to Top](#welcome-to-rc4hdb-user-guide)

---

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### File Command Format:
* All file commands have a `FOLDER_NAME` or `FILE_NAME` field depending on the command that is being used. 
* `FOLDER_NAME` signifies the name of the **sub** data folder that is being used.
* `FILE_NAME` refers to the [CSV](#glossary-of-terms) file to be targeted.
* Do not include any file types in the `FOLDER_NAME` or `FILE_NAME`. A file type is the description that comes after the `.` in a file. For example, The file name of the file `residents.csv` is just `residents`.
* The following symbols are not to be used in `FOLDER_NAME` or `FILE_NAME`:
  * Empty spaces
  * `.` dots
  * `/` forward slashes
  * `\ ` backslashes

### Examples:
* `rc4_data_2022` is a valid `FOLDER_NAME`/`FILE_NAME`.
* `rc4_data_2022.json` is an invalid `FOLDER_NAME`/`FILE_NAME` due to the inclusion of the file type, `.json`.
* The following are invalid `FOLDER_NAME`/`FILE_NAME` due to the inclusion of restricted symbols.
  * `rc4 data 2022` has empty spaces.
  * `rc4.data.2022` has dots.
  * `rc4/data/2022` has forward slashes.
  * `rc4\data\2022` has backslashes.

## **Quality-Of-Life**

As an application optimized for keyboard usage, **RC4HDB** may not be the most intuitive for someone that is used to using the mouse. As
such, we have provided several simple *Quality-of-life* features that we hope can improve your experience of using
**RC4HDB**.

## Keyboard shortcuts

To encourage keyboard usage, here are several keyboard shortcuts that you may find useful for your use:

| Key        | Functionality                                  |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Esc`      | Closes the Help Window if it's open            |
| `F1`       | Opens the Help Window if it's not open         |
| `F3`       | Quick-access to the command input box          |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Switch between Resident and Booking tabs       |

This feature is especially useful if you want to refer to our Help Window which contains a summary of our most basic
commands. If you want a full summary of all our commands, refer to [here](#command-summary).

## **Upcoming Features**

This section lists some of our upcoming features that we are excited to bring to you!

### Exporting to CSV file : `file export`

As important as it is to be able to import files, we also understand that you might have the need to export them.
**RC4HDB** will soon provide users with the ability to export data to `.csv` files.
The file will be safe to remove from the `[JAR file location]/data` folder.

Format: `file export FILE_NAME`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The csv file will be exported in this format <a href="https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w12-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#csv-file-format">format</a>. </div>

Examples:
* `file export residents` will export the data from `residents.json` file into a `.csv` file named `residents.csv`.

### *More coming soon!*

## **FAQ**

**Q: I type very slowly, is RC4HDB any good for me?**

**A**: You do not have to be fast at typing for RC4HDB to improve your workflow!

<br>

**Q: I have accidentally deleted an entry, is there any way for me to undo it?**

**A:** Currently, we do not offer such an option, but you can look forward to RC4HDB v1.5, as we will be implementing that in the near future!

<br>

**Q: The text on the screen is too small, is there any way for me to resize it?**

**A:** RC4HDB does not allow the text size to be changed, however, you can enlarge the text by changing your screen resolution. You may
refer to this [link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/change-your-screen-resolution-in-windows-5effefe3-2eac-e306-0b5d-2073b765876b) for Windows, and this [link](https://www.wikihow.com/Change-the-Screen-Resolution-on-a-Mac) for Mac.

<br>

**Q: Do I need an internet connection to be able to use RC4HDB?**

**A:** You do not need an internet connection to use RC4HDB as everything is done on your device.

<br>

**Q: Can I search using fields other than the name?**

**A:** You can use the `filter` command to search for people using the other fields.

<br>

**Q: Why is there a need to use `hideonly` if we can already use `showonly`?**

**A:** You can use `hideonly` when you want to display more fields than you want to hide. For example,
`hideonly i` has the same effect as `showonly n p e r g h m t` on a full table. Using `hideonly` helps to save 
time on typing!

<br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Q: How do I remember which commands use letters (as compared to other commands which use key/value) as inputs?**

**A:** Only the column hiding features, i.e. `showonly` and `hideonly`, use letters. You can remember this by 
associating the "only" in these commands to the convenience of typing *only* letters!

<br>

**Q: The section for `showonly` and `hideonly` says that `i n p e r g h m t` are valid letters. However, I am getting an error message that says "Please enter columns to show or hide that are currently in the table view." when using these valid letters.** 

**A:** `i n p e r g h m t` *are* indeed valid letters. Recall that `showonly` and `hideonly` [only work on columns that are currently shown in the table view](#showing-only-some-columns--showonly).
This means that for `showonly n p e` and `hideonly n p e` to work, the **name**, **phone**, and **email** columns *must 
be present* in the current table. The error message mentioned above means that the specified columns are 
*not fully present* in the table. Please make sure to *only* enter letters corresponding to the columns you see on your 
screen when typing these commands. 

<br>

**Q: How can I resize the columns in the table?**

**A:** Column resizing can be done the same way as they do in Excel. However, we only allow the resizing of the `Name` and `Email` columns.
They other have a fixed size to allow for your ease of viewing. Alternatively, you could also use the `showonly` and `hideonly` commands if you
do not wish to see them.

<br>

**Q: I can not find the information that I need in the User Guide, who can I contact?**

**A:** You can drop us an email at *nseah21@gmail.com* .

2. In a population demographic dataset, one possible field is the age of each individual.

### CSV

This term is short for Comma-separated values. It is a common file type that can be identified through the `.csv` after a file's name.

### JSON
