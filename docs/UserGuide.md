## Introduction

JeeqTracker is a desktop application created for **home-based business owners / resellers** that helps them manage the clients
that they interact with by keeping track of their **`BUY / SELL`** transactions, and **`REMARKS`** of clients.

While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).
If you can type fast, JeeqTracker can get business
interactions recorded faster and simpler than traditional GUI applications.

To get you started, you might want to read the section on [how to use this User Guide](#how-to-use-the-user-guide)!

An overview of the application's user interface can be found [here](#user-interface-overview).

## How to use the User Guide

This user guide contains detailed explanation on how to use the application. It provides information like what each `command` does, **warnings** for certain commands, and how data is saved in the application.

The [table of contents](#table-of-contents) provides links to every command. But before you head there, below are some notes on how to interpret each command format.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/Alice`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/friend` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/friend`, `t/friend t/family` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `n/Alice n/Bob`, only `n/Bob` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list`, `exit` and `clear`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.

</div>

### Symbols

Below are some symbols that you may encounter in the User Guide.
