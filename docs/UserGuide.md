# User Guide

If you can type fast, CinternS can get your internship application management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps. It consists of several useful features which the users are able to execute using commands.

## Features

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add c/COMPANY_NAME`, `COMPANY_NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add c/Google`.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `d/DATE p/POSITION`, `p/POSITION d/DATE` is also acceptable.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `list` and `exit`) will be ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `list 123`, it will be interpreted as `list`.
