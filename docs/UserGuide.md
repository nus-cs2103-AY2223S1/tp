# 1. Introduction

## 1.1. What is FinBook?

**FinBook is a desktop application for you as a Financial Advisor (FA) to manage your client details and ensure that
your data is secured.** With FinBook, you can set a unique [password](#422-setting-or-updating-the-password--password),
[manage](#41-managing-a-client) and [view](#417-viewing-portfolio-of-a-specific-client-view) client’s details,
meetings and portfolio as well as many [other features](#43-general) to make your daily workflow much
**more efficient**!

FinBook is optimized for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)**, which means most of our commands are done by
typing.
If you can type fast, managing your clients will be a breeze with FinBook. Can’t type fast? Don’t worry!
Our Graphical User Interface (GUI) will help you slowly adjust to using our CLI.

So what are you waiting for? Start using FinBook.

## 2.3. Command format

Commands in FinBook are constructed using a command word. Most commands consist of a command word, prefixes
and parameters

For example,
![Annotated command](images/updated_command.png)

1. **Command word**: Indicates what action you want FinBook to do. For this example, the command word `add` will add
   a client into FinBook
2. **Prefix**: To specify the field of data added. Each prefix always ends with a `/`. For this example, `n/` indicates
   the
   client's name, `p/` indicates the client's phone number, etc.
3. **Parameter**: Provides supplementary information to the command word or prefix. For this example, `John Doe` is the
   parameter for `NAME`

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">

**:information_source: Notes about the command format:**<br>

* Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the parameters to be supplied by the user.<br>
  e.g. in `add n/NAME`, `NAME` is a parameter which can be used as `add n/John Doe`.

* Items in square brackets are optional.<br>
  e.g `n/NAME [t/TAG]` can be used as `n/John Doe t/VIPClient` or as `n/John Doe`.

* Items with `…`​ after them can be used multiple times including zero times.<br>
  e.g. `[t/TAG]…​` can be used as ` ` (i.e. 0 times), `t/VIPClient`, `t/VIPClient t/DoeFamily` etc.

* Parameters can be in any order.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER`, `p/PHONE_NUMBER n/NAME` is also acceptable.

* If a parameter is expected only once in the command but you specified it multiple times, only the last occurrence of
  the parameter will be taken.<br>
  e.g. if you specify `p/12341234 p/56785678`, only `p/56785678` will be taken.

* Extraneous parameters for commands that do not take in parameters (such as `help`, `list`, `exit` and `delete all`)
  will be
  ignored.<br>
  e.g. if the command specifies `help 123`, it will be interpreted as `help`.
