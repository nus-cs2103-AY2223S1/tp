## Running tests

There are two ways to run tests.

* **Method 1: Using IntelliJ JUnit test runner**
  * To run all tests, right-click on the `src/test/java` folder and choose `Run 'All Tests'`
  * To run a subset of tests, you can right-click on a test package,
    test class, or a test and choose `Run 'ABC'`
* **Method 2: Using Gradle**
  * Open a console and run the command `gradlew clean test` (Mac/Linux: `./gradlew clean test`)

## Types of tests

This project has three types of tests:

1. **Unit tests** targeting the lowest level methods/classes.<br>
   e.g. `seedu.foodrem.commons.util.StringUtilTest`
1. **Integration tests** that are checking the integration of multiple code units (those code units are assumed to be working).<br>
   e.g. `seedu.foodrem.storage.StorageManagerTest`
1. **Hybrids of unit and integration tests.** <br> These test are checking multiple code units as well as how they are connected together.<br>
   e.g. `seedu.foodrem.logic.LogicManagerTest`
