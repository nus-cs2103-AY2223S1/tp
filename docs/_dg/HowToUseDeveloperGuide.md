Thank you for your interest in how FoodRem works! We are delighted you are reading this guide and we aim to provide you with all the necessary information to understand, maintain, upgrade, and evolve FoodRem.

```tip
You do not need to read the Developer Guide in a sequential order. However, we recommend going through the section on [Design](#design) to have a high-level overview of this application before searching for information that concerns you. Most portions of the developer guide can be understood if you have a good overview of FoodRem's design. 
```

The Developer Guide has six main components:

1. [Design](#design)
1. [Implementation](#implementation) 
1. [Documentation, Configuration and Other Guides](#documentation-configuration-and-other-guides)
1. [Requirements](#requirements)
1. [Instructions for manual testing](#instructions-for-manual-testing)
1. [Effort](#effort)

As a **developer**, the first three sections would be most applicable to you. The section on [Design](#design) gives you a high-level overview of how the application is structured and what the key components are in FoodRem. After reading the section on design, the section on [Implementation](#implementation) covers how items, tags, statistics and general features are implemented. Lastly, the section on [Documentation, Configuration and Other Guides](#documentation-configuration-and-other-guides)

If you are in the **marketing** or **product** team or want to know why FoodRem was created, the section on [Requirements](#requirements) covers the [Product Scope](#product-scope), [User Stories](#user-stories), [Use Cases](#use-cases), and [Non-Functional Requirements](#non-functional-requirements).

If you are a **tester**, the section on [Instructions for manual testing](#instructions-for-manual-testing) would be most applicable to you. It covers how to launch and shutdown the application and how to test some commands in FoodRem.

Last but not least, [Effort](#effort) shares the difficulty in implementing FoodRem and the challenges faced.

You can also refer to the [Glossary](#glossary) for definitions of commonly used terms in FoodRem.
