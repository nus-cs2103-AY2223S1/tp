The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

#### Main components of the architecture

`Main` has two classes called [Main]({{ page.master_branch }}/{{ page.main_src }}/Main.java) and [MainApp]({{ page.master_branch }}/{{ page.main_src }}/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:

* Initializing the components in the correct sequence during the app launch
* Connecting the components with each other during the app launch
* Shutting down the components during shut down
* Invoking cleanup methods where necessary during shut down

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [UI](#ui-component): Handles the User Interface of the App
* [Logic](#logic-component): Handles the execution of commands
* [Model](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory
* [Storage](#storage-component): Reads data from and writes data to the hard disk

[Commons](#common-classes) contain a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

#### How the architecture components interact with each other

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other in the scenario where the user issues the command `del 1`. This deletes the first item from the [[ item-list-box:Item List Box ]].

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name} Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (Reason: to prevent outside components from being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.
