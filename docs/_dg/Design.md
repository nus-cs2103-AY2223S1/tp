This section gives you a high-level overview of how the application is structured and what the key components of FoodRem are.

The [Architecture](#architecture) section gives an overview of how the main components in FoodRem interact with one another.

FoodRem has four main components, and each section describe smaller subcomponents within them.
The main components are namely:

1. [Ui Component](#ui-component)
1. [Logic Component](#logic-component)
1. [Model Component](#model-component)
1. [Storage Component](#storage-component)

The section on [Common Classes](#common-classes) covers useful classes used by multiple components.
