As an application optimized for keyboard usage, **RC4HDB** may not be the most intuitive for someone that is used to using the mouse. As
such, we have provided several simple *Quality-of-life* features that we hope can improve your experience of using
**RC4HDB**.

## Keyboard shortcuts

To encourage keyboard usage, here are several keyboard shortcuts that you may find useful for your use:

| Key        | Functionality                                  |
|------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `Esc`      | Closes the Help Window if it's open            |
| `F1`       | Opens the Help Window if it's not open         |
| `F2`       | Highlights the first row of the displayed list |
| `F3`       | Quick-access to the command input box          |
| `Ctrl+Tab` | Switch between Resident and Booking tabs       |

This feature is especially useful if you want to refer to our Help Window which contains a summary of our most basic
commands. If you want a full summary of all our commands, refer to [here](command-summary.md).

### Accessing command history

Use the `↑ Up` and `↓ Down` arrow keys to navigate through the command history. This
is useful if your next command is similar to a previous command, or if you wish to revisit
your previous commands.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
Only valid commands will be saved in the history!
</div>


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Any valid command typed but not entered
