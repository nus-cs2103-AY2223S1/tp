### Exporting to CSV file : `file export`

As important as it is to be able to import files, we also understand that you might have the need to export them.
**RC4HDB** will soon provide users with the ability to export data to `.csv` files.
The file will be safe to remove from the `[JAR file location]/data` folder.

Format: `file export FILE_NAME`

:information_source: The csv file will be exported in this [format](file-management.md#csv-file-format).<br>

Examples:
* `file export residents` will export the data from `residents.json` file into a `.csv` file named `residents.csv`.

### *More coming soon!*
