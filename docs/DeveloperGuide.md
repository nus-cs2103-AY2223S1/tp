### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CenterPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible _GUI_.

The `CenterPanel` comprises two different panels within it, namely `PersonListPanel` and `ReminderListPanel`, with each of them displaying any number of `PersonCard` and `ReminderCard` respectively.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model` in the `PersonCard` as well as the `ReminderCard`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="1000" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
Changed features will also be described here.

### Add feature

#### Implementation

The Add mechanism is facilitated by `AddCommand` and `AddCommandParser`. It allows users to add a contact into their contact list and specify the contacts'
`Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Birthday`, `Address`, and `Tags` to be stored and associated with the `Person` contact created.

#### Example Usage

Step 1: The user inputs `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/johnd@example.com a/John street, block 123, #01-01 b/18-08-2000 t/friend`. This adds a person with `Name`
John Doe with the specified details into the contact list.

Step 2: `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with the user input.

Step 3: `AddressBookParser` will parse the command word and create a new `AddCommandParser` and call its function `parse` with the index as the arguments.

Step 4: The `AddCommandParser#parse` will then parse the arguments and create a new `AddCommand` object.

Step 5: The `LogicManager` then calls `AddCommand#execute`.

Step 6: The `AddCommand` communicates with the `Model` to add the person by calling `Model#addPerson`.

Step 7: `AddCommand` then returns a new `CommandResult` with the result of the execution.

![Sequence diagram for the Add Command](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Edit feature

#### Implementation

The Edit mechanism is facilitated by `EditCommand` and `EditCommandParser`. It allows users to edit a contact from their contact list and specify which attribute of the contacts' `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Birthday`, `Address`, and `Tags` to be changed with the `Person` contact created.

#### Example Usage

Step 1: The user inputs `edit 1 p/91234567 e/johndoe@example.com`. This the phone number and email address of the person with an index of 1 to be `91234567` and `johndoe@example.com` respectively.

Step 2: `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` with the user input.

Step 3: `AddressBookParser` will parse the command word and create a new `EditCommandParser` and call its function `parse` with the rest of the user input as the arguments.

Step 4: The `EditCommandParser#parse` will then parse the insurance prefixes to create a new `EditPersonDescriptor` object.

Step 5: The `EditCommandParser#parse` will then create a new `EditCommand` object using the index and the `EditPersonDescriptor` object.

Step 5: The `LogicManager` then calls `EditCommand#execute` with the `Model` object.

Step 6: The `EditCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList` to get the filtered `List` of `Person` objects.

Step 7: The `EditCommand` gets the `Person` to be edited from the `List`

Step 8: The `EditCommand` calls its `createEditedPerson` method with the `Person` to be edited and the `EditPersonDescriptor` which returns the new edited `Person` .

Step 9: The `EditCommand` calls the `setPerson` method of the `Model` object to replace the existing `Person` object with the new edited one.

Step 11: The `EditCommand` then returns a new `CommandResult` object with the result of the execution.

Step 12: The `LogicManager` then returns the `CommandResult` object.

</div>

### Insurance feature

#### Implementation

The Insurance mechanism is facilitated by `InsuranceCommand` and `InsuranceCommandParser`. It allows users to store whether a contact in their contact list has the four main types of insurance.
The four main types of insurances are modelled by the classes `LifeInsurance`, `DisabilityInsurance`, `CriticalIllnessInsurance` and `HealthInsurance` which inherit from the abstract `Insurance` class.

The types of insurances are specified by prefixes inputted by the user:
* li/ - Life Insurance
* di/ - Disability Insurance
* ci/ - Critical Illness Insurance
* hi/ - Health Insurance

`Insurance` fields are stored in the `Person` class, and consist of the boolean `hasInsurance` which is set to true if `Person` object has the type of insurance.

For prefixes not included in the command, the `Person` object is taken to not have the corresponding types of insurance.

Below is an example usage scenario.

#### Example Usage

Step 1: The user inputs `insurance 1 li/ di/`. This indicates that the user wants to update the first contact in the displayed contact list such that he only has life insurance and disability insurance.

Step 2: `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` with the user input.

Step 3: `AddressBookParser` will parse the command word and create a new `InsuranceCommandParser` and call its function `parse` with the rest of the user input as the arguments.

Step 4: The `InsuranceCommandParser#parse` will then parse the insurance prefixes to create a new `EditInsuranceDescriptor` object.

Step 5: The `InsuranceCommandParser#parse` will then create a new `InsuranceCommand` object using the index and the `EditInsuranceDescriptor` object.

Step 6: The `LogicManager` then calls `InsuranceCommand#execute` with the `Model` object.

Step 7: The `InsuranceCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList` to get the filtered `List` of `Person` objects.

Step 8: The `InsuranceCommand` gets the `Person` to be edited from the `List`

Step 9: The `InsuranceCommand` calls its `createEditedPerson` method with the `Person` to be edited and the `EditInsuranceDescriptor` which returns the new edited `Person` .

Step 10: The `InsuranceCommand` calls the `setPerson` method of the `Model` object to replace the existing `Person` object with the new edited one.

Step 11: The `InsuranceCommand` then returns a new `CommandResult` object with the result of the execution.

Step 12: The `LogicManager` then returns the `CommandResult` object.

</div>

### Delete feature

#### Implementation

The delete mechanism is facilitated by `DeleteCommand` and `DeleteCommandParser`. It allows users to delete a contact from their contact list by either `INDEX` or `NAME`.

#### Example Usage

Step 1: The user inputs `delete 2` to delete the 2nd person in the displayed contact list.

Step 2: `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with the user input.

Step 3: `AddressBookParser` will parse the command word and create a new `DeleteCommandParser` and call its function `parse` with the index as the arguments.

Step 4: The `DeleteCommandParser#parse` will then parse the index and create a new `DeleteCommand` object.

Step 5: The `LogicManager` then calls `DeleteCommand#execute`.

Step 6: The `DeleteCommand` communicates with the `Model` to delete the person by calling `Model#deletePerson`.

Step 7: `DeleteCommand` then returns a new `CommandResult` with the result of the execution.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the delete command:

![Activity diagram for the Delete Command](images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)

### Remind feature

#### Implementation

The Remind mechanism is facilitated by `RemindCommand` and `RemindCommandParser`. It allows users to set a reminder message and date, for a contact from the contact list.

The `Reminder` objects for each `Person` is stored in the `Person` object as a `SortedList` where the predicate for sorting is based on the `date` attribute in `Reminder`.

The `UI` component then displays all the `Reminder` for all `Person` objects in `AddressBook.persons` in the `ReminderListPanel`.

#### Example Usage

Step 1: The user inputs `remind 1 r/zoom call d/10-10-2023` to create a reminder for the 1st contact in the displayed contact list.

Step 2: `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser` with the user input.

Step 3: `AddressBookParser` will parse the `remind` command word and create a new `ReminderCommandParser` and call `ReminderCommandParser#parse` with the rest of the user input as the arguments.

Step 4: The `ReminderCommandParser#parse` will then parse the index, task and date to create a new `ReminderCommand` object.

Step 5: The `LogicManager` then calls `ReminderCommand#execute`.

Step 6: The `ReminderCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredPersonList` to get the filtered `List` of `Person` objects.

Step 7: The `ReminderCommand` gets the `Person` to be edited from the `List`, using `List#get`.

Step 8: The `ReminderCommand` calls `Model#addReminder`, with the edited `Person` and the given `Reminder` as parameters. The `Person` will be updated to include the given `Reminder`.

Step 9: `ReminderCommand` then returns a new `CommandResult` with the result of the execution.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ReminderCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to store a reminder:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store `Reminder` as a field under a `Person`.
    * Pros: Allows for more features to be built on reminders (e.g: automated birthday reminders)
    * Cons: Results in higher coupling which may make maintenance and testing harder.

* **Alternative 2:** Store `Reminder` as a separate class
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May be harder to implement automatically generated reminders.

### Delete Reminder feature

#### Implementation

The mechanism to delete a reminder is facilitated by `DeleteReminderCommand` and `DeleteReminderCommandParser`.

#### Example Usage

Step 1: The user inputs `deleteR 2` to delete the 2nd person in the displayed contact list.

Step 2: `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` with the user input.

Step 3: `AddressBookParser` will parse the `deleteR` command word and create a new `DeleteReminderCommandParser` and call its function `parse` with the index as the arguments.

Step 4: The `DeleteReminderCommandParser#parse` will then parse the index and create a new `DeleteReminderCommand` object.

Step 5: The `LogicManager` then calls `DeleteReminderCommand#execute`.

Step 6: The `DeleteReminderCommand` communicates with the `Model` to delete the reminder by calling `Model#deleteReminder`.

Step 7: `DeleteReminderCommand` then returns a `CommandResult` indicating the result of the execution.

![Sequence diagram for the DeleteR Command](images/DeleteReminderSequenceDiagram.png)

## **Appendix C: Automated GUI Testing**

The application makes use of the [TestFX](https://github.com/TestFX/TestFX) library to carry out automated tests for
the GUI. Below are common issues when trying to carry out GUI tests.

#### Problem: Keyboard and Mouse movements are not simulated in macOS systems, resulting in GUI tests failure

* Reason: From macOS Mojave onwards, applications that do not have `Accessibility` permissions cannot simulate
such keyboard and mouse movements. Therefore, the GUI tests that require simulation of keyboard and mouse movements
to test the GUI cannot function properly and fail.

* Solution: Open `System Preferences`, click `Security and Privacy`, then `Privacy`, and then `Accessibility`.
Then check the box beside `IntelliJ IDEA`. The figure below shows `Accessibility` permission being granted to
`IntelliJ IDEA`.

<img src="images/TroubleshootingGUiTestMacos.png" width="500px">

#### Problem: GitHub Actions Ubuntu environment cannot run GUI tests, resulting in Continuous Integration tests failure

* Reason: The automated GUI tests require tools on different Linux distributions to run properly as they need to
display a GUI. The environment that GitHub Actions provides does not have these. Therefore, the GUI tests are
getting stuck and taking very long to build with no success and this is causing Continuous Integration checks to
fail.

* Solution: Update the [`gradle.yml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-2/tp/blob/master/.github/workflows/gradle.yml) file to make use of an additional [action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/gabrielbb-xvfb-action)
on GitHub actions that installs [XVFB](http://elementalselenium.com/tips/38-headless) and runs headless tests with
it. The figure below shows the new actions used to enable the CI environment to run the GUI tests properly.
