### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nus/climods/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nus/climods/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user 
issues the command `rm CS2103`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nus/climods/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ModuleListPanel`,  `SavedModuleListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

Modules are represented by `ModuleCard` and `SavedModuleCard` respectively. These parts encapsulate `Pill`s to capture information such as the semester that the mod is available in and the Module Credits of that mod.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nus/climods/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `ModuleCard` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/nus/climods/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CliModsParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `ListCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. list all modules offered by the CS Faculty).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("rm cs2103")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `rm CS2103` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CliModsParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `CliModsParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nus/climods/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the module list data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/nus/climods/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both module list data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `CliModsStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `nus.climods.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Module with Semester Feature

#### Implementation

The add command allows the user to add for a particular `UserModule` together with `SemesterData`. 
It is facilitated by `AddCommand`.
It extends the `Command` class.

Users can add their `UserModule` with the Command:
- `add <MODULE_CODE> <SEMESTER_CODE>`
- e.g. `add CS1101S s1`

#### Parsing of commands 
`PositionalParameter` manages parsing and error handling for parameters expected to be at a certain index in the 
list of arguments. New parameter classes can extend from `PositionalParameter` to support repeated parameters across 
commands, e.g module code.

`ModuleCodeParameter` checks if the user's input fits the module code format. An exception is thrown
if the module code supplied had an incorrect format.

`SemesterParameter` will check for valid semester code input.
An exception will be thrown if semester code is invalid.

#### Design Considerations:

- Create a `SemesterParameter` class
- Modify `AddCommand` class

### Command History - `<Up>/<Down>` command

The command history feature allows user to traverse and scroll through the command history that is
recorded when he/she uses `CliMods`. The goal is to mirror the behavior of a terminal/shell
interface where user can easily access his/her previous command by using the up and down arrow keys.

#### Implementation

The command history is facilitated by `CommandSession`. The aim of `CommandSession` is to act as a
lightweight wrapper around the command execution process, handling the reading and writing to and
from the command history.

Within `CommandSession`, we make use of an index pointer (`commandHistoryPos`) to keep track of which 
position the user is currently at in the command history. The use of the index pointer allows us to 
create a generator-like method to update and retrieve the user position in the command history.

- `CommandSession::getPreviousCommand()`
    - Retrieves the previous command in the command history, and updates the internal index pointer
      to the next position (upward) in the command history.

- `CommandSession::getNextCommand()`
    - Retrieves the next command in the command history, and updates the internal index pointer to
      the next position (downwards) in the command history.

> Note that both of these operations are not pure, since the internal index pointer
> is updated after an invocation of either operations.

#### Design considerations

Depending on the shell, the behavior of how command history is being stored is different. For
example, all commands are recorded in `bash`, while in `zsh`, no consecutive duplicate commands will
be recorded.

`CLiMods` chose to emulate the `zsh` behavior instead as it reduces clutter in the command history.
We also hope that this would improve user experience as it aims to also speed up the traversal of
the command history.

### UserGuide - `help` command
The `help` command displays our User Guide in a new window, using javafx WebViewer.  It acts as a browser, so we prevent
the user from connecting to other websites that is not within our control.

It is added this way because the user guide website is automatically built from our markdown file.
This makes it easier to maintain changes in the user guide or developer guide.
We do not control other websites, and we want the user to only view the user guide and other information on our website.

We also considered just displaying the link with a `Copy URL` button.  However, the user has to copy the link into
their web browser, making the user experience not smooth.
