### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `project -d 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`ProjectListPanel`, `IssueListPanel`, `ClientListPanel`, `ResultDisplay`, `HelpWindow` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src//main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command to result in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddClientCommand`). More specifically,
   1. If the command is specific to an entity (e.g. `Project`, `Client` or `Issue`), this results in a `CommandParser` object (More specifically, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `ClientCommandParser`).
      1. This `XYZCommandParser` object then yields a `Command` object (more specifically, a derived class of `ProjectCommand`, `ClientCommand` or `IssueCommand` respectively).
   2. Otherwise, it results in a `Command` Object directly.
2. The resulting `Command` object is then executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `ClientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddClientCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `ClientCommandParser`, `IssueCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

#### Entity Initialisation

* In some instances, we note that an entity object (`Project`, `Issue` or `Client`) object cannot be created together with the `XYZCommand` object, since we may need access to the `model` object at the point of initialisation (for instance, to generate the next ID number when creating an entity).
* Given this, we opt to _partially initialise_ entity objects using the clas `XYZWithoutModel`.
* These are done mainly when creating the `AddXYZCommand` objects.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the partial initialisation logic during the creation and execution of a `AddProjectCommand` object.

<img src="images/ParserPartialInitialisationSequenceDiagram.png" width="450" />

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="1000" />

The `Model` component,


* stores the project book data i.e., all `Project`, `Client`, and `Issue` objects (which are contained in separate `UniqueEntityList` objects).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Project`, `Client`, or `Issue` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Project>`, `ObservableList<Client>` or `ObservableList<Issue>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramNew.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both project book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).
* handles all parsing of objects in `StorageUtil`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some details on how certain features are implemented.

### List Command Feature

The list mechanism is facilitated by `MainWindow`. It contains a `CommandBox` which listens for user command input and a JavaFX `StackPane` which holds the current entity list to be displayed. Upon the execution of either a `ListProjectCommand`, `ListClientCommand` or `ListIssueCommand`, the following operations are carried out:
* `MainWindow#swapProjectListDisplay()`â€‰â€”â€‰Changes the current display to a list of projects.
* `MainWindow#swapClientListDisplay()`â€‰â€”â€‰Changes the current display to a list of clients.
* `MainWindow#swapIssueListDisplay()`â€‰â€”â€‰Changes the current display to a list of issues.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `StackPane` will be initialized by default with a list of projects.

Step 2. The user executes `client -l` to view a list of clients. The `ListClientCommand` is executed and calls `MainWindow#swapClientListDisplay()`, clearing the current collection of child nodes of the `StackPane` and adds the root of a `ClientListPanel` to the emptied child nodes. The list of clients is now shown in the UI.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** If the current display is already the same as that requested by the user, it will still call the respective setter methods, although the actual UI display will not change.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works:

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ListClientCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a list command:

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The diagrams above are generalized to `Client` but work similarly for other entity types (`Project`, `Issue`).
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How list executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** The children nodes of the `StackPane` are cleared and the root of the desired list type is added every time a list `Command` is executed.
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: The same `StackPane` is being reused for different entities. Misses out on potential polymorphism benefits.

* **Alternative 2:** The children nodes of the `StackPane` are never cleared and holds a single list of entities (`Project`, `Client`, `Issue`) and the list is filtered for the desired instance type for each list `Command`.
  * Pros: Less duplication of code.
  * Cons: Leads to more `instanceof` checks. Not much common behaviour between the entity classes to be abstracted via polymorphism.

### Default View Command Feature

The default view mechanism is facilitated by `GuiSettings`. It is stored internally as a `DefaultView` enumeration which can take either of three values, `PROJECT`, `CLIENT` or `ISSUE`. Upon the execution of either a `SetProjectDefaultViewCommand`, `SetClientDefaultViewCommand` or `SetIssueDefaultViewCommand`, the following operation is called:
* `GuiSettings#setDefaultView()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the default view variable to the specified `DefaultView` type.

This operation is exposed in the Model interface as `Model#setDefaultView()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the default view mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The list of projects is shown by default.

Step 2. The user executes `client -v` to set the default view to clients. The `SetClientDefaultViewCommand` is executed and calls `Model#setDefaultView()`, setting the default view to the list of clients.

Step 3. The next time the user launches the application, the list of clients is shown by default.

The following sequence diagram shows how the default view operation works:

![DefaultViewSequenceDiagram](images/DefaultViewSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SetClientDefaultViewCommand`

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The diagrams above are generalized to `Client` but work similarly for other entity types (`Project`, `Issue`).
</div>
  
### Add Command Feature

A key functionality of DevEnable is the ability to add projects, issues, and clients into the system. The command word for adding will be `project`, `issue`, or `client`, depending on which entity is being added.
This is followed by the flag `-a`, representing an Add command. Next, it is followed by a series of prefixes-value pairs to initialise the entity, some of which are compulsory while others are optional.
When a user enters a valid Add command in the interface, `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` will be called which processes the inputs, creates an instance of a command parser, and calls the `ProjectCommandParser#parse`,
`IssueCommandParser#parse` or `ClientCommandParser#parse` method, depending on which entity is being added. Within this method, the flag `-a` will be detected, calling `ProjectCommandParser#parseAddProjectCommand`, 
`IssueCommandParser#parseAddIssueCommand`, or `ClientCommandParser#parseAddClientCommand`, depending on which entity is added, which checks for input and prefix-value pair validity with methods in `ParserUtil`.
Finally, the parsed arguments are passed into and returned in an instance of the Add Command entity and the `AddProjectCommand#execute`, `AddIssueCommand#execute`, or `AddClientCommand#execute` is called depending
on which entity is added, which retrieves the respective entity list from the system, adds the entity into the list to update it, and have the UI display the updated filtered entity list.   

#### Add Project Command
Compulsory prefixes: n/VALID_NAME  
Optional prefixes: c/VALID_CLIENT_ID, r/VALID_REPOSITORY, d/VALID_DEADLINE  
Example Use: `project -a n/John c/1 r/JohnDoe/tp d/2022-03-05`  

#### Add Issue Command
Compulsory prefixes: p/VALID_PROJECT_ID, t/VALID_TITLE  
Optional prefixes: d/VALID_DEADLINE, u/VALID_URGENCY  
Example Use: `issue p/1 t/To create a person class which stores all relevant person data d/2022-12-10 u/0`  

#### Add Client Command
Compulsory prefixes: n/VALID_NAME, p/VALID_PROJECT_ID  
Optional prefixes: m/VALID_MOBILE_NUMBER, e/VALID_EMAIL  
Example Use: `client -a n/John Doe m/98765432 e/johnd@example.com p/1`  

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command operation works for adding a project entity:
Example: `project -a n/Team Project`

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddProjectCommand` 
should end at destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Add command access to the model:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** Only `AddProjectCommand:execute`, `IssueCommandParser:execute` and `ClientCommandParser:execute` have access to the Model.
* Pros: No coupling between Parser class and Model class.
* Cons: Mappings could not be performed within the parser.

**Alternative 2:** Refactor `ProjectCommandParser:parseAddProjectCommand`, `IssueCommandParser:parseAddIssueCommand` and `ClientCommandParser:parseAddClientCommand` to have access to the Model.
 * Pros: Mappings could be performed within the parser which fitted its responsibility.
 * Cons: May result in extra coupling between Parser class and Model class.
 
Taking into consideration the extra coupling involved, Alternative 1 was chosen as the current design for add command access to the model.

### Delete Command Feature

A key functionality of DevEnable is the ability to delete projects, issues, and clients into the system. The command 
word for deleting will be `project`, `issue`, or `client`, depending on which entity is being deleted.
This is followed by the flag `-d`, representing a Delete Command. Next, it is followed by a compulsory argument to 
initialise the entity.
When a user enters a valid Delete Command in the interface, `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` will be called which 
processes the inputs, creates an instance of a command parser, and calls the `ProjectCommandParser#parse`,
`IssueCommandParser#parse` or `ClientCommandParser#parse` method, depending on which entity is being added. Within 
this method, the flag `-d` will be detected, calling `ProjectCommandParser#parseDeleteProjectCommand`,
`IssueCommandParser#parseDeleteIssueCommand`, or `ClientCommandParser#parseDeleteClientCommand`, depending on which 
entity is deleted, which checks for input argument validity with methods in `ParserUtil`.
Finally, the parsed arguments are passed into and returned in an instance of the Delete Command entity and the 
`DeleteProjectCommand#execute`, `DeleteIssueCommand#execute`, or `AddClientCommand#execute` is called depending
on which entity is deleted, which retrieves the respective entity list from the system, deletes the entity from the 
list to update it, and have the UI display the updated filtered entity list.

#### Delete Project Command

Compulsory argument: VALID_PROJECT_ID
Example Use: `project -d 1`

#### Delete Issue Command
Compulsory argument: VALID_ISSUE_ID
Example Use: `issue -d 2`

#### Delete Client Command
Compulsory argument: VALID_CLIENT_ID
Example Use: `client -d 3`
 
The following sequence diagram shows how the delete command operation works for deleting a client entity:
Example: `client -d 1`

![DeleteSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommand` 
should end at destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Delete Command's access to the model:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** Only `ProjectCommand:execute`, `IssueCommandParser:execute` and `ClientCommandParser:execute` have access to the Model.
* Pros: No coupling between Parser class and Model class.
* Cons: Mappings could not be performed within the parser.

**Alternative 2:** Refactor `ProjectCommandParser:parseDeleteProjectCommand`,`IssueCommandParser:parseDeleteIssueCommand` and `ClientCommandParser:parseDeleteClientCommand` to have access to the Model.
* Pros: Mappings could be performed within the parser which fitted its responsibility.
* Cons: May result in extra coupling between Parser class and Model class.

Taking into consideration the extra coupling involved, Alternative 1 was chosen as the current design for Delete 
Command's access to the model.

### Edit Command Feature

A key functionality of DevEnable is the ability to edit projects, issues and clients currently in the system. The command word for editing will be `project`, `issue`, or `client`, depending on which entity it being edited.
This is followed by the flag `-e`, representing an Edit command. Next, it is followed by a series of prefixes-value pairs, one compulsory pair for identifying the entity to be edited, and at least one pair indicating the fields to be edited.
When a user enters a valid Edit command in the interface, `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` will be called which processes the inputs, creates an instance and calls the `ProjectCommandParser#parse`, 
`IssueCommandParser#parse` or `ClientCommandParser#parse` method, depending on which entity is being edited. Within this method, the flag `-e` will be detected, calling `ProjectCommandParser#parseEditProjectCommand`, 
`IssueCommandParser#parseEditIssueCommand`, or `ClientCommandParser#parseEditClientCommand`, depending on which entity is edited, which checks for input and prefix-pair validity with methods in `ParserUtil`.
Finally, the parsed arguments are passed into and returned in an instance of the Edit Command entity and the `EditProjectCommand#execute`, `EditIssueCommand#execute`, or `EditClientCommand#execute` is called depending on
which entity is edited, which retrieves the respective entity from its entity list in the system, edits the fields of the entity, updates it, and have the UI display the updated filtered entity list.

#### Edit Project Command
Compulsory prefix: p/VALID_PROJECT_ID  
Optional prefixes (at least one to be included): n/VALID_NAME, c/VALID_CLIENT_ID, r/VALID_REPOSITORY, d/VALID_DEADLINE  
Example Use: `project -e p/1 n/Jeff c/1 r/Jeffrey/tp d/2022-07-05`  

#### Edit Issue Command
Compulsory prefix: i/VALID_ISSUE_ID  
Optional prefixes (at least one to be included): t/VALID_TITLE, d/VALID_DEADLINE, u/VALID_URGENCY  
Example Use: `issue -e i/1 t/To edit issue command d/2022-04-09 u/1`  

#### Edit Client Command
Compulsory prefix: c/VALID_CLIENT_ID  
Optional prefixes (at least one to be included): n/VALID_NAME, m/VALID_MOBILE_NUMBER, e/VALID_EMAIL, p/VALID_PROJECT_ID  
Example Use: `client -e c/1 n/BenTen m/12345678 e/Ben10@gmail.com p/1`

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit command operation works for editing an issue entity:
Example: `issue -e i/1 t/To edit issue command d/2022-04-09 u/1`

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations: 

**Aspect: Editing of entity fields:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** For each possible field to be edited, a new object of that field, with the parsed argument(if any) or null value, is created in `ProjectCommandParser#parseEditProjectCommand`, `IssueCommandParser#parseEditIssueCommand` or `ClientCommandParser#parseEditClientCommand`, then passed as arguments into `EditProjectCommand`, `EditIssueCommand` or `EditClientCommand`. 
Within `EditProjectCommand#execute`, `EditIssueCommand#execute` and `EditClientCommand#execute`, set the fields to the new field objects.
* Pros: No creation of a new entity object
* Cons: Requires use of multiple accessors for various fields of each entity.

**Alternative 2:** For each possible field to be edited, a new object of that field, with the parsed argument(if any) or null value, is created in `ProjectCommandParser#parseEditProjectCommand`, `IssueCommandParser#parseEditIssueCommand` or `ClientCommandParser#parseEditClientCommand`, then passed as arguments into `EditProjectCommand`, `EditIssueCommand` or `EditClientCommand`.
Within `EditProjectCommand#execute`, `EditIssueCommand#execute` and `EditClientCommand#execute`, retrieve the entity to be edited and create a new entity with the new field objects and the original fields not to be edited.
* Pros: Only requires getters for fields, preventing field values from being easily edited.
* Cons:  Creation of a new entity object, requiring modification of entity list.

Taking into consideration the potential issues with ID that came with modifying the entity lists, Alternative 1 was chosen as the current design for editing fields of an entity.

### Sort Command Feature

The sort feature sorts the entities in their respective entity lists in the Model according to a specified `key` and `order`. The View pulls the new entity lists from the Model and displays them. Upon the execution of
either a `SortProjectCommand`, `SortIssueCommand` or `SortClientCommand`, the `AddressBook#sortXXXByYYY()` is invoked (where XXX is the `entity` and YYY is the `key` to be sorted by) which obtains the entity class's 
modifiable `ObservableList` as imported from the JavaFX collections, and calls its `sorted()` method that, depending on the specified `order`, takes in a comparator function specifying how to sort the entities.

#### Sort Project Command
Keys (exactly one key to be included): p, d, i, n  
Orders (exactly one order to be included): 0, 1  
General Form: `project -s KEY/ORDER`  
Example Use: `project -s d/0`  

#### Sort Issue Command
Keys (exactly one key to be included): i, d, u  
Orders (exactly one order to be included): 0, 1  
General Form: `issue -s KEY/ORDER`  
Example Use: `issue -s u/1`  

#### Sort Client Command
Keys (exactly one key to be included): c, n  
Orders (exactly one order to be included): 0, 1  
General Form: `client -s KEY/ORDER`  
Example Use: `client -s c/1`  

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How sorted entities are stored in the Model:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort entities directly on their original entity lists. After `SortProjectCommand`, `SortIssueCommand` or `SortClientCommand`, the original entity list gets manipulated and is rendered to the View.
* Pros: Saves lots of space
* Cons: Sort commands manipulate the original entity list in order to change the display on view

**Alternative 2:** Maintain a separate sorted entity list for each entity and their purpose is to store each entity in their sorted order. After `SortProjectCommand`, `SortIssueCommand` or `SortClientCommand`, the respective sorted entity list gets manipulated and is rendered to the View.
* Pros: The original entity lists will not be affected by manipulations made through sorting in order to change the display on view 
* Cons: To maintain such a sorted entity list for Project, Issue and Client will take up considerable space
    
Alternative 1 was chosen because it saves space when sorting entities. The command to set default view of each entity helped overcome the cons of directly manipulating of the original list. This meant rebooting the app removed the previous entity sort order and revert to the default order. 

### Pin Command Feature

The pin mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It contains a `UniqueEntityList` for each entity type. Upon the execution of either a `PinProjectCommand`, `PinClientCommand` or `PinIssueCommand`, the following operations are carried out:
* `AddressBook#sortProjectsByPin()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the current project list according to pin.
* `AddressBook#sortClientsByPin()`, `AddressBook#sortIssuesByPin()`â€‰â€”â€‰Similar function as above, but for clients and issues.
* `AddressBook#sortProjectsByCurrentCategory()` â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the current project list according to the last known sorting category.
* `AddressBook#sortClientsByCurrentCategory()`, `AddressBook#sortIssuesByCurrentCategory()`â€‰â€”â€‰Similar function as above, but for clients and issues.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as methods with the same name e.g. `Model#sortProjectsByPin()`, `Model#sortProjectsByCurrentCategory()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the pin mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user creates an entity with a unique ID. The entity is unpinned by default and will be displayed according to the current sorting order.

Step 2. The user executes `client -p 3` to pin the 3rd client in the project book. The `PinClientCommand` is executed and calls `Client#togglePin()`, toggling the `Pin` attribute of the 5th client from `false` to `true`. This is followed by a call to `Model#sortClientsByCurrentCategory()` and `Model#sortClientsByPin()`, which displays the sorted client list with pinned clients (now including the 4th client) at the top.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** If the current client is already pinned, `Client#togglePin()` will toggle the `Pin` attribute of the client from `true` to `false` and call the latest sort order, causing the client to be displayed in its original position.
</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the pin operation works:

![PinSequenceDiagram](images/PinSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `PinClientCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a pin command:

![PinActivityDiagram](images/PinActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The diagrams above are generalized to `Client` but work similarly for other entity types (`Project`, `Issue`).
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How entities can be unpinned:**

**Alternative 1 (current choice):** The same command e.g. `PinClientCommand` used to pin the entity is also used to unpin the entity.
* Pros: Less duplication of code and less commands for the user to remember.
* Cons: Lesser separation of responsibilities as the same command is used for different (but similar) functionality.

**Alternative 2:** An additional separate unpin command is created e.g. `UnpinClientCommand`.
* Pros: Better separation of responsibilities as one command is used to pin and the other is used to unpin the entity. There is no overlap.
* Cons: More duplication of code, additional command for user to remember with roughly the same functionality.

### Find Command Feature

A key functionality of DevEnable is the ability to find projects, issues and clients by searching for specific 
keywords in different attributes of these entities. The command word for finding will be `project`, `issue`, or 
`client`, depending on which entity it being edited. This is followed by the flag `-f`, representing a Find command.
Next, it is followed by a series of prefixes-value pairs, least one which is compulsory, representing the fields and 
keywords to search and thereby identifying the entity to be found. When a user enters a valid Find command in the 
interface,`AddressBookParser#parseCommand` will be called which processes the inputs, creates an instance and calls 
the `ProjectCommandParser#parse`, `IssueCommandParser#parse` or `ClientCommandParser#parse` method, depending on 
which entity is being found. Within this method, the flag `-f` will be detected, calling 
`ProjectCommandParser#parseFindProjectCommand`, `IssueCommandParser#parseFindIssueCommand`, or 
`ClientCommandParser#parseFindClientCommand`, depending on which entity is found, which checks for input and 
prefix-pair validity with methods in `ParserUtil`. Finally, the parsed arguments are passed into and returned in an 
instance of the Find Command entity and the `FindProjectCommand#execute`, `FindIssueCommand#execute`, or 
`FindClientCommand#execute` is called depending on which entity is found, which retrieves the respective entity from 
its entity list in the system, searches for the keywords the fields of the entity, matches it so as to filter the 
entities with such fields, and have the UI display the updated filtered entity list.

#### Find Project Command

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Find Command's access to the model:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** Only `ProjectCommand:execute`, `IssueCommandParser:execute` and `ClientCommandParser:execute` have access to the Model.
* Pros: No coupling between Parser class and Model class.
* Cons: Mappings could not be performed within the parser.

**Alternative 2:** Refactor `ProjectCommandParser:parseFindProjectCommand`,`IssueCommandParser:parseFindIssueCommand` 
and `ClientCommandParser:parseFindlientCommand` to have access to the Model.
* Pros: Mappings could be performed within the parser which fitted its responsibility.
* Cons: May result in extra coupling between Parser class and Model class.

Taking into consideration the extra coupling involved, Alternative 1 was chosen as the current design for Find 
Command's access to the model.

**Aspect: Find Command's validation of input keywords:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** All keywords must pass the validation check based on their respective prefixes.
* Pros: Helps to differentiate between no items being listed because none matched the search criteria and because the
  criteria was invalid.
* Cons: The user can only search by valid keywords and thus has less flexibility in choosing inputs.

**Alternative 2:** The keywords need not pass the validation check for their respective prefixes.
* Pros: The user has greater freedom in choosing the inputs which is a more familiar experience with respect to
  other such apps.
* Cons: There is ambiguity in cases where no items are listed as to whether it is because such an item can never exist
  in the list or if it does not exist at the time of search.

Taking into consideration the need for clear system feedback to the user, Alternative 1 was chosen as the current
design for Find Command's validation of input keywords.

**Aspect: How Find Command matches a keyword against the target in a given field:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** At least one word in the target must match exactly with the keyword.
* Pros: The search result is more precise and concise which makes it easier for the user to navigate and the keyword 
  can be validated for each prefix which makes it easier for the user to use a variety of prefixes and keywords.
* Cons: Partial searches are not supported as the user needs to search by whole words.

**Alternative 2:** At least a part of the target must match with the keyword.
* Pros: The user can make partial searches and search for parts of a word.
* Cons: The filtered list might be more cluttered and input validation might not be supported.

Taking into account the ease of use and the benefits of input validation, Alternative 1 was chosen as the current 
design to match keywords against targets.

**Aspect: How Find Command handles multiple keywords for name and title prefixes:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** At least one word in the target must match exactly with at least one keyword.
* Pros: The user can search for many keywords at once such that the user can filter the list based on multiple criteria.
* Cons: The user can not search by sentences or phrases.

**Alternative 2:** At least one word in the target must match exactly with all keywords.
* Pros: The user can search for exact sentences or phrases.
* Cons: The user can not search based on many keywords and may not be able to remember long phrases to use this
  effectively.

Taking into account the ease of use when the user can search for long titles or names by remembering non-continuous 
words as opposed to a long phrase and the relevance of the design decision being specific to the name and title 
prefixes, Alternative 1 as chosen as the current design to handles multiple keywords for the name and title prefixes.

**Aspect: How Find Command handles multiple arguments with the same prefix:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** At least one word in the target is in the union of the set of keywords 
from multiple arguments with the same prefix.
* Pros: The user can search for many keywords at once such that the user can filter the list based on multiple
  criteria and more convenient to expand search criteria without having to alter prefix arguments already typed.
* Cons: It might be redundant with the multi keyword search for arguments with name and title prefixes.

**Alternative 2:** At least one word in the target matches with the keyword from the last argument with the same prefix.
* Pros: It prevents redundancy with the search made when multiple keywords are present for an argument with the name
  and title prefixes.
* Cons: It does not allow the user to easily expand his search criteria and might be harder to remember.

Taking into account the benefits of improving flexibility of use by allowing the user to expand the search criteria 
as he types without having to edit a part of the command already typed and the redundancy being restricted to only 
certain prefixes, Alternative 1 was chosen as the current design to handle multiple arguments with the same prefix.

**Aspect: How Find Command handles multiple arguments with different prefixes:**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** Find all items that fulfil the search criteria for all prefixes in the input.
* Pros: The user can search based on criteria across different fields to obtain a more specific list of items.
* Cons: A mistake in specifying the keyword for one prefix can result in the desired item not appearing on the list.

**Alternative 2:** Find all items that fulfil the search criteria for at least one prefixes in the input.
* Pros: A mistake in specifying the search criteria for one prefix may not result in the desired item being filtered 
  out.
* Cons: May be hard for the user to find specific items on the list that fulfill different criteria.

Taking into account the benefits of improving specificity of use by allowing the user to search based on multiple 
criteria all of which must be fulfilled, Alternative 1 was chosen as the current design to handle multiple arguments 
with different prefixes.

### Mark/Unmark Issue Command Feature

An important feature of DevEnable is the ability to mark issues as completed or incomplete.
The command word will be `issue`, followed by the flag `-m`, representing a Mark command, which marks the issue as completed, or `-u` representing an Unmark command, which marks the issue as incomplete.
Next, it is followed by a compulsory argument, representing the `issueId`, to initialise the issue.

#### Mark Issue Command

When a user enters a valid Mark command in the interface, `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` will be called which processes the inputs, creates an instance of a command parser and calls the `IssueCommandParser#parse` method.
Within this method, the `-m` flag is detected, calling `IssueCommandParser#parseMarkIssueCommand`, which checks for input argument validity (only positive integers) with the `ParserUtil#parseIssueID` method.
A new `status` object, initialised with `isCompleted` equals `true` is created. The parsed issueId and new status object are passed into and returned in an instance of the `MarkIssueCommand`, `MarkIssueCommand#execute` is called,
which retrieves the issue with the parsed issueId from the `IssueList` in the system. The status of the issue is set to the new status object, list is updated and the UI displays the updated filtered issue list.

Compulsory argument: VALID_ ISSUE_ID
Example use: `issue -m 1`

#### Unmark Issue Command

When a user enters a valid Unmark command in the interface, `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` will be called which processes the inputs, creates an instance of a command parser and calls the `IssueCommandParser#parse` method.
Within this method, the `-u` flag is detected, calling `IssueCommandParser#parseUnmarkIssueCommand`, which checks for input argument validity (only positive integers) with the `ParserUtil#parseIssueID` method.
A new `status` object, initialised with `isCompleted` equals `false` is created. The parsed issueId and new status object are passed into and returned in an instance of the `UnmarkIssueCommand`, `UnmarkIssueCommand#execute` is called,
which retrieves the issue with the parsed issueId from the `IssueList` in the system. The status of the issue is set to the new status object, list is updated and the UI displays the updated filtered issue list.

Compulsory argument: VALID_ISSUE_ID
Example use: `issue -u 2`

The following sequence diagram shows how the mark command operation works for marking an issue entity (unmark works in the same manner):
Example: `issue -m 1`

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `MarkIssueCommand`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Method to mark and unmark issues**

**Alternative 1: (current choice)** Separate Mark command to mark status as completed and Unmark command to mark status as incomplete, regardless of current status of issue.
* Pros: Requires minimal user input and user can set desired status without reference to current status. Responsibilities of each command are separate and clear.
* Cons: More commands for the user to remember and more duplication of code.

**Alternative 2:** A single Mark command which flips the status of the issue (completed issues become incomplete and vice versa).
* Pros: Requires minimal user input, only one command to remember and less duplication of code.
* Cons: Requires user to refer to the current state in order to set it as the desired state. Less separation in terms of responsibilities.

**Alternative 3:** A single Mark command which takes in issue id as well as the completion status to mark the issue as (completed or incomplete)
* Pros: Only one command to remember, less duplication of code and user can set desired status without reference to current status.
* Cons: Requires user to remember the valid input state (`completed` and `incomplete`). Less separation in terms of responsibilities.

Alternative 1 was chosen as the design method since it allowed users to set the desired status regardless of current status
with the shortest and easiest to type command possible. It also allowed for command purposes and responsibilities to be kept clear and separate.
