## **Overview**

Watson is a powerful **desktop database application** that reduces the administrative workload of **primary/secondary school teachers** greatly.

It provides a **centralized** platform for teachers to handle and retrieve student data **conveniently**, namely:
* student particulars
* student grades
* student attendance

It is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a
Graphical User Interface (GUI).

This Developer Guide provides general information for developers interested in understanding
the design implementation of Watson for further development.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [Main](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [MainApp](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
---

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [UiManager.java](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/UiManager.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

We added a new UI component in our implementation: the `LoginWindow`.
The `LoginWindow` is a separate window that is displayed when the user first starts the application.
The `LoginWindow` is responsible for authenticating the user and retrieving the user's data from the `Storage` component.
The `LoginWindow` will then pass the user's data to the `MainWindow` so that the `MainWindow` can display the user's data.

`LoginWindow` inherits from the abstract `UiPart` class, just like the `MainWindow`.
As of 20/10/2022, it consists of 2 `TextBox` FXML components and a "submit" `Button` FXML component.

We also added a new UI component in our implementation: the `GradeWindow`.
The `GradeWindow` is a separate GUI window that is displayed when the user enters the `GradeCommand`.
The `GradeWindow` allows users to enter the `Grade` for an `Assesment` for all students taking a `Subject` as specified by the `GradeCommand`


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
---

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
---

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" height="300" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
---

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit feature

#### Current Implementation

The edit command consists of these following classes:

- `EditCommand` which extends `Command`
- `EditCommandParser` which extends `Parser<EditCommand>`

As with all other commands, the edit command has a `Parser` subclass that goes through the `AddressBookParser` and a `Command` subclass that returns an appropriate new `CommandResult` Object.
It allows the editing of a student's name, phone, email, address, class, remarks and tags.

The command will be used as such:
- `edit INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE] [e/EMAIL] [a/ADDRESS] [c/CLASS] [rem/REMARK] [t/TAG]`
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by the user.
- Words in square brackets are optional, but at least one of them must be present.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
---

### Sort feature

#### current Implementation

The sort command consists of these following classes:

- `SortCommand` which extends `Command`
- `SortCommandParser` which extends `Parser<SortCommand>`

As with all other commands, the sort command has a `Parser` subclass that goes through the `AddressBookParser` and a `Command` subclass that returns an appropriate new `CommandResult` Object. It sorts the list of students by their grades in ascending or descending order as specified by the user.

The command will be used as such:
- sort by English grade in ascending order - e.g.`sort asc s/ENGLISH`
- sort by Math grade in descending order - e.g. `sort desc S/MATH`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
---

### Grade feature

#### current Implementation

The Grade command consists of these following classes:

- `GradeCommand` which extends `Command`
- `GradeCommandParser` which extends `Parser<GradeCommand>`
- `GradeWindow` which extends `UiPart`

As with all other commands, the Grade command has a `Parser` subclass that goes through the `AddressBookParser` and a `Command` subclass that returns an appropriate new `CommandResult` Object. It opens a new `GradeWindow` to start the grading process.

The command will be used as such:
- entering grades for an `Assignment` using the follow command format - `grade SUBJECT_NAME_TOTALSCORE_WEIGHTAGE_DIFFICULTY`,
  e.g.`grade MATH_CA1_100_0.4_0.1`
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by the user.

The command works in the following steps: <br>
1) Users enter the `GradeCommand` following the above specified format in the `CommandBox`, providing `Subject` and `Assessment` details such as assessment name, total score, weightage and difficulty <br>
2) `GradeCommandParser` will parse the `GradeCommand` to check whether the parameters provided are valid and return a `CommandResult` with a `StudentList`, which is a list of `Students` filtered by the specified `Subject` <br>
3) If the parameters are valid, a `GradeWindow` GUI will be opened which will prompt the user to enter the `Grade` of the first `Student` in the `StudentList`<br>
4) Once the grade is entered, the method `updateUiToNextStudent` will be called to update the `Student` specified in the `GradeWindow` to the next available `Student` in the `StudentList`. <br>
5) Repeat step 4 until  the grades of all `Students` in the `StudentList` have been entered accordingly. <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
---

### Grade Prediction feature

#### current Implementation
Watson follows the following steps to predict a student's grade:

1) Calculate the percentage of classes attended by the student. Let's call this the student's **learning rating**.

For each of the student's previous assessments, perform the following procedure:

1.1. Take the difficulty of the assessment, then apply the following formula:


`(difficulty x learning rating)`


Let's call this number the **difficulty bonus**.

1.2. Add the **difficulty bonus** to the student's grade for the assessment.
We call this their **normalized score**. <br>
2) Take the average of the student's **normalized scores** for all their previous assessments,
   then add the difficulty of the assessment to predict. This is the final prediction!

The GradePrediction command consists of these following classes:

- `PredictionCommand` which extends `Command`
- `PredictionCommandParser` which extends `Parser<PredictionCommand>`
- `predictionUtil` utility class to handle the logic of grade prediction
- `predictionWindow` which extends `UiPart`

As with all other commands, the `PredictionCommand` command has a `Parser` subclass that goes through the `AddressBookParser` and a `Command` subclass that returns an appropriate new `CommandResult` Object. It opens a new GUI window to start the grading process

The command will be used as such:
-`predict n/NAME s/SUBJECT diff/DIFFICULTY`
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by the user.

The command works in the following steps: <br>
1) Users enter the `PredictionCommand` following the above specified format in the `CommandBox`, providing the name of the `Student`, `Subject` and `Difficulty` <br>
2) `PredictionCommandParser` will parse the `PredictionCommand` to check whether the provided arguments are valid and return a `CommandResult` <br>
3) The `PredictGrade` method in `PredictionUtil` class will be used to predict the grade given the arguments provided <br>
4) A new `PredictionWindow` will be opened to display the predicted grade <br>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
---

### Attendance feature

#### current Implementation

The Attendance command consists of these following classes:

- `AttendanceCommand` which extends `Command`
- `AttendanceCommandParser` which extends `Parser<Attendance>`

As with all other commands, the `AttendanceCommand` command has a `Parser` subclass that goes through the `AddressBookParser` and a `Command` subclass that returns an appropriate new `CommandResult` Object. It marks the attendance of students from a specified `studentClass` on a given `Date`

The command will be used as such:
- `markAtt d/DATE c/STUDENTCLASS ind/INDEXES` eg. `markAtt d/12-02-2023 c/1.2 ind/1 2 3`
- Words in `UPPER_CASE` are the inputs to be supplied by the user.

The command works in the following steps: <br>
1) Users enter the `AttendanceCommand` following the above specified format in the `CommandBox`, providing the `Date`, `StudentClass` and `Indexes` of students present <br>
2) `AttendanceCommandParser` will parse the `AttendanceCommand` to check whether the provided arguments are valid <br>
3) For each `Student` in the specified `StudentClass`, the `updateAttendance` method in the `Attendance` class is called to update the model to indicate whether the `Student` is present. <br>
