### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/friday/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/friday/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/friday/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/friday/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/friday/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FridayParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.
![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FridayParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `FridayParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/friday/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the FRIDAY data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Friday`, which `Student` references. This allows `Friday` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/friday/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both FRIDAY data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `FridayStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `friday.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort feature
#### Rationale
Students in FRIDAY have details such as name, Telegram handle, consultation and Mastery Check dates, and grades.
This feature enables the sorting of students using the aforementioned details as criteria. With many students to keep track of, we
decided to add this feature to allow users to quickly organize their students in different ways.

#### Implementation

The current implementation of the sort feature allows users to sort all students based on the given criteria, in ascending
or descending order. The classes corresponding to the current list of criteria are: `Name`, `TelegramHandle`, `Consultation`,
`MasteryCheck`, and `Grade`.

In this section, we will use the following Activity Diagram to outline the process when the `sort` command is executed.

![Sort Command Activity Diagram](images/SortCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The `sort` command will be executed by `SortCommand`. Before that, `SortCommandParser` uses instances of `Prefix` and
`Order` in `CliSyntax` to parse the user input and decide what comparator is passed to `SortCommand`. The sorted list
is stored as `sortedStudents` in `ModelManager`, and is updated every time `SortCommand` is run.

To assist with the sorting, classes `Name`, `TelegramHandle`, `Consultation`, and `MasteryCheck` implement the `Comparable`
interface, where the natural ordering of `String` and `LocalDate` are used to implement the `compareTo` method. The `Grade`
class does not implement the interface as its attributes are `String`s.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

1. FRIDAY initialises an `ObservableList<Student>` named `students` and
   a `SortedList<Student>` named `sortedStudents` upon launch.

2. The user executes `sort n/a` command to sort the students by name in ascending order.

3. The user input is passed to
   `LogicManager`, which then calls the `SortCommandParser#parse` method to parse the argument `n/a`.

4. The `SortCommandParser` checks that the criteria and order are valid, and creates a `SortCommand` with a `Comparator`
   that orders the student names alphabetically.

5. The `LogicManager` calls the `SortCommand#execute` method, which in turn calls  `Model#updateSortedStudentList`
   to update `sortedStudents` with the given `Comparator`.

6. The list `students` is set to `sortedStudents`, after which  `CommandResult` is returned by the `SortCommand` to signal success.

7. The `StudentListPanel#setList` method is called to refresh the
   `ListView` in the UI with the new `students` list, and the success message from `CommandResult` is displayed.

The following Sequence Diagram summarises the aforementioned steps.

![Sort Command Sequence Diagram](images/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How many criteria should the `sort` command accept**

|                                                                                 | **Pros**                                                                                     | **Cons**                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Option 1 (current choice)** <br> Accept only one criterion                    | Easier to implement and also clearer for the user                                            | Unable to further sort students with a secondary criteria should the first criteria of some students match |
| **Option 2** <br> Accept multiple criteria and sort in the order they are given | More precise sorting when many students have matching details, e.g. same Mastery Check dates | Sorting becomes confusing for the user and difficult to implement if many criteria are given               |

### Alias feature
#### Rationale
Some advanced users might want to customise the command words.
This feature will allow them to do so, enabling these users to be more efficient in using FRIDAY.

#### Implementation
The current implementation of the alias feature will allow users to add a non-empty one word alias for a [default command](#glossary).

The following activity diagram will outline the process when the `alias` command is executed.

![Alias Command Activity Diagram](images/AliasCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The alias command will be executed by `AliasCommand`. Aliases added will be stored in a `AliasMap`, while
default command names (e.g. add, delete) will be stored in a constant `LIST_RESERVED_KEYWORD` in the `ReservedKeyword` class.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the alias mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. FRIDAY will initialise a `Friday`
with an empty `AliasMap`.

2. The user executes `alias a/ls k/list` command to add an alias `ls` for the default command `list`. `FridayParser` will parse
`alias` and create a new `AliasCommandParser`.`AliasCommandParser` will parse `a/ls k/list` and create an `AlliasCommand` with `Alias("ls")`
and a `ReservedKeyword("list")`. When executing the `AliasCommand`, the command will check that `list` is in the `LIST_RESERVED_KEYWORD`,`ls` is not in the
`AliasMap` and `ls` is a valid alias. After all the conditions are fulfilled, `Model#addAlias(Alias("ls"), ReservedKeyword("list"))` will be called to add
this alias-keyword mapping into `AliasMap`.

3. The user executes `ls` using the alias of the `list` command. `Model#getKeyword("ls")` will check `AliasMap` in `Model`
for an alias-keyword mapping. As there is a mapping of `ls` to `list`, `Model#getKeyword("ls")` will return `list`.
`list` will then be assigned to `commandWord` in `FridayParser`. `commandWord` will then be used to get the command to be executed.
`ListCommand` will then be executed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the alias `ls` is used to execute the default command `list`.
![Using Alias Sequence Diagram](images/UsingAliasSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How `Alias` is stored in `AliasMap`**

|                                                                                          | **Pros**                       | **Cons**                                                                                                                                                                                     |
|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Option 1 (current choice)** <br> Stored as an Alias-ReservedKeyword mapping in a Map   | Fast with O(1) time complexity | At high capacity, there might be complications due to collision in Map                                                                                                                       |
| **Option 2** <br> Alias and ReservedKeyword stored within an association class in a List | Can store more Aliases         | To get an Alias, iteration through the whole list must be done causing the time complexity to be at O(Number of Aliases) and this might cause performance issues when there are many aliases |


### Grade Feature
#### Rationale
FRIDAY allows the user to record their students' grades for assessments and examinations in CS1101S. There are 5
assessments in CS1101S, namely Reading Assessment 1 (RA1), Reading Assessment 2 (RA2), Practical Assessment, Midterm
exam, and the Final exam. Each student in FRIDAY will have a list of their grades for the 5 assessments, showing the
name of the assessment and the student's score for the assessment. Users are able to view and edit the individual
students' grades for the assessments.

#### Implementation
The `grade` command is executed by `GradeCommand`. In CS1101S, the 5 main examinations are Reading Assessment 1, Reading Assessment 2, Practical Assessment, Midterm exam, and Final exam, which are denoted by "ra1", "ra2", "pa", "mt", and "ft" respectively.

For each student, there are 5 grades, each with the result scored by the student, in percentages between 0% and 100% inclusive, and up to 2 decimal places, and the name of the examination it is associated with.
The grades are then stored in a `GradesList` which is unique for every student and has a fixed length of 5 for every student managed by the user.

![Grade Command Activity Diagram](images/GradeCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The 5 grades are stored as `Grade` objects in a unique `GradesList` for each student. `GradesList` uses a `HashMap` for
the data structure in storing the `Grade` objects as it allows for fast access of the individual grades. It is also
useful for potential future implementation where there may be more grades in the module, hence allowing FRIDAY to be
expandable and adaptable for such possible scenarios. `ArrayList` is only utilised when the order of the grades is
necessary, such as when displaying the grades in the GUI and for storage purposes.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the grading mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes the `grade 5 ra1/90 pa/69.90` command to edit the grades of Reading Assessment 1 and
Practical Assessment for the 5th student in FRIDAY. `GradeCommandParser` checks that the command is valid, and searches for the specific scores from the user's input using the `Prefix` of the examinations. `GradeCommandParser` then creates a new `EditGradeDescriptor` which is then used to create the new `GradeCommand`.

2. The `GradeCommand` will access the `GradesList` of the specified student and the individual grades specified by the user. The `GradesList` is updated, where Reading Assessment 1 and Practical Assessment examinations are updated with the new scores, and the other examinations have the same scores as before.

The following Sequence Diagram summarises the aforementioned steps.

![Grade Command Sequence Diagram](images/GradeSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Should we allow users to determine the examinations**

|                                                                                                 | **Pros**                                                                                                                           | **Cons**                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Option 1 (current choice)** <br> Fix the examinations in the list of grades for every student | Standardised for every student, without the need to check, create or delete examinations for every student, and easy to implement. | Less freedom for users. Unaccounted for unforeseen circumstances (e.g. There is a change in the assessments for the CS1101S module).                                                          |
| **Option 2** <br> Allow users to create and delete their own examinations                       | Provides freedom for users and flexibility for changes in the grading system of the module.                                        | Not standardised for every student, and more prone to user error, as each examination will thus need to create new unique prefixes and identity to know which examination it is referring to. |

**Aspect: Should we allow users to set the scores of each grade in their own way (e.g. "99%", "A", "65/70", etc.)**

|                                                                                             | **Pros**                                                                                                                                         | **Cons**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Option 1 (current choice)** <br> Standardise scoring of each grade in terms of percentage | Standardised and neat for every assessment and for every student, applicable for the 5 assessments in the CS1101S module, and easy to implement. | Less flexible for assessments whereby percentage scores are not applicable. (e.g. Pass/Fail assessments, alphabetical grading, etc.), and the possible need to manually calculate the percentage.                                          |
| **Option 2** <br> Users can input the scores in any String they desire                      | More flexibility and freedom for user                                                                                                            | Very difficult to check for valid scores due to large number of possibility, not standardised for every student and grade, less able to compare the students' strengths and weaknesses in certain assessments, and difficult to implement. |


### Find feature
#### Rationale
FRIDAY allows the user to search through all the fields entered for any student and outputs a modified list of students that match the criteria. This list can then be modified and the changes will be reflected in the storage used.
This can be used to search for a particular student based on keywords.

#### Implementation
The find command is executed similar to all other commands. It goes through the parser and is interpreted using the
logic established. However, it is unique in the sense that it will look through all the possible fields and data
and return matches.

Below is the activity diagram depicting how the find function is implemented

![Find command activity diagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The `find` command will be executed by `FindCommand`. Before that, `FindCommandParser` parses the user input and decide what predicate is passed to `FindCommand`. The filtered list
is stored as `filteredStudents` in `ModelManager`, and is updated every time `FindCommand` is run.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

1. FRIDAY initialises an `ObservableList<Student>` named `students` and
   a `FilteredList<Student>` named `filteredStudents` upon launch.

2. The user executes `find keyword` command to sort the students by name in ascending order.

3. The user input is passed to
   `LogicManager`, which then calls the `FindCommandParser#parse` method to parse the argument `keyword`.

4. The `FindCommandParser` checks that the criteria is valid, and creates a `FindCommand` with a `Predicate`
   that is used to filter the students list.

5. The `LogicManager` calls the `FindCommand#execute` method, which in turn calls  `Model#updateFilteredStudentList`
   to update `sortedStudents` with the given `Predicate`.

6. The list `students` is set to `filteredStudents`, and the `StudentListPanel#setList` method is called to refresh the
   `ListView` in the UI with the new `students` list.

The following sequence diagram summarizes the aforementioned steps.

![Find command sequence diagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Should we allow users to find block keywords :**

|                                                                          | **Pros**                                                                   | **Cons**                                                                        |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Option 1 (current choice)** <br> Allow user to find by single keywords | Provides more search results and the expected student is part of the list. | The expected student may not appear at the top of the list due to lexicography. |
| **Option 2** <br> Allow users to find by block keywords                  | Possibly more accurate searches.                                           | Higher possibly that search is unsuccessful due to error in keywords.           |

### Mark feature
#### Rationale
FRIDAY allows users to mark the Mastery Checks of certain students as passed. This would help the user keep track of which students have already completed and passed their Mastery Checks.

#### Implementation
The mark command is implemented by a `MarkMasteryCheckCommand`. The `MasteryCheck` of a student contains a boolean `isPassed`, which is set to false by default for sample students and when a student is added to the list.

Below is an activity diagram depicting the implementation of the mark command.

![mark command activity diagram](images/MarkCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The `MarkMasteryCheckCommand` checks for the following conditions to determine if the student's Mastery Check can be marked as passed:
1. The given student's Mastery Check is not empty.
2. The given student's Mastery Check has not already been marked as passed.
3. The given student's Mastery Check date is not beyond the current date.
   * e.g. A student with their Mastery Check scheduled for 2030-09-01 cannot be marked as passed if the current date is 2022-11-07.

Only if all 3 of these conditions are met will the `MarkMasteryCheckCommand` set `isPassed` of the given student's Mastery Check to `true`, hence marking it as passed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the marking mechanism behaves at each stage.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. FRIDAY will open with a list populated with sample students whose Mastery Checks have `isPassed` set to `false` by default.
2. The user executes the `mark 1` command to mark the Mastery Check of the first student as passed. `MarkMasteryCheckCommandParser` checks that the command is valid. If so, it creates a new `MarkMasteryCheckCommand` with 1 as the `index`.
3. The `MarkMasteryCheckCommand` checks student 1's Mastery Check for the 3 conditions listed above. Since student 1's Mastery Check meets all 3 of these conditions, the `MarkMasteryCheckCommand` sets the value of the student's Mastery Check's `isPassed` to `true`.

The following Sequence Diagram summarises the aforementioned steps.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Should we allow users to mark empty Mastery Checks as passed**

| **Option 1 (current choice)** <br> Do not allow marking of empty Mastery Checks | More intuitive and makes more sense                                                                                | May be useful in certain cases                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Option 2** <br> Allow marking of empty Mastery Checks                         | Could be useful in certain cases, for example when a student is exempted from having to complete the Mastery Check | These cases are rare. Also does not make sense to allow this as there is an empty Mastery Check means that the student has not scheduled or completed any Mastery Check. Hence, there is nothing to be marked as passed |


### Unmark feature
#### Rationale
FRIDAY allows users to unmark the Mastery Checks of certain students as passed. This would be useful in cases where the user accidentally marks the Mastery Check of a student who has not passed their Mastery Check.

#### Implementation
The unmark command is implemented by an `UnmarkMasteryCheckCommand`. As mentioned above the `MasteryCheck` of a student contains a boolean `isPassed`, which is set to false by default but can be changed to `true` by a `MarkMasteryCheckCommand`.

Below is an activity diagram depicting how the unmark command is implemented.

![Unmark command activity diagram](images/UnmarkCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The `UnmarkMasteryCheckCommand` checks for the following conditions to determine if the student's Mastery Check can be unmarked:
1. The given student's Mastery Check is not empty.
2. The given student's Mastery Check has already been marked as passed.

Only if both of these conditions are met will the `UnmarkMasteryCheckCommand` set `isPassed` of the given student's Mastery Check to `false`, hence unmarking it as passed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the marking mechanism behaves at each stage.

1. The user launches the application for the first time. FRIDAY will open with a list populated with sample students whose Mastery Checks have `isPassed` set to `false` by default.
2. The user executes the `mark 1` command to mark the Mastery Check of the first student as passed.
3. The user realises this was a mistake, as they actually wanted to mark the Mastery Check of another student as passed.
4. The user executes the `unmark 1` command to unmark the Mastery Check of the first student. `UnmarkMasteryCheckCommandParser` checks that the command is valid. If so, it creates a new `UnmarkMasteryCheckCommand` with 1 as the `index`.
5. The `UnmarkMasteryCheckCommand` checks student 1's Mastery Check for the 2 conditions listed above. Since student 1's Mastery Check meets both of these conditions, the `UnmarkMasteryCheckCommand` sets the value of the student's Mastery Check's `isPassed` to `false`.

The following Sequence Diagram summarises steps 4 to 5.

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java 11 or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 100 students without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. Should be able to hold up to 50 aliases without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
4. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.

### Glossary

1. **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
2. **Private contact detail**: A contact detail that is not meant to be shared with others
3. **Teaching Assistant:** Teaching assistants (TA) are people who help and support teachers or lecturers to provide and coordinate effective classroom instruction. For CS1101S, teaching assistants are undergraduate students who have completed the module. The role of a CS1101S TA involves planning, preparing and delivering weekly tutorial sessions, marking assignments and monitoring their students' progress and engagement levels.
4. **Reading Assessment**: Assessments in the form of online quiz with Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQ). There are a total of two reading assessments, namely RA1 and RA2, throughout the semester. Reading Assessments have weightage in the students' final grade for the module.
5. **Mastery Check**: An assessment of the students' understanding of topics conducted by the user (the teaching assistants).
There are two Mastery Checks through the semester. Students will be assessed by their knowledge of the topics covered by presenting to their teaching assistant in pairs.
Since users have to arrange dates to meet with their students to conduct the Mastery Checks, FRIDAY allows users to record the scheduled dates for each student.
6. **Default Command**: The original command word for a command in FRIDAY. (e.g. `add`,`sort`)

## **Appendix: Effort**
<b>FRIDAY</b> was built over a period of 6 weeks. It is build upon, AddressBook Level-3, as well as design,plan out and implement <b>FRIDAY</b> 

### Difficulty level

We believe that we have worked hard during this entire project to come with a product that is functional and widely applicable.
If the difficulty of the individual project is a 5 the difficulty of implementing <b>FRIDAY</b> was a 8. This is because:

* We pushed more complex designs and features that required more planning and trial and error and learning along the way.
* Working as a team also meant that we had to delegate admin tasks and designate roles on a weekly basis which was a challenge for us as well.

### Challenges Faced

* Evolving and refactoring existing code from AB3 resulted in many problems, such as:
    * Existing automated test cases failing due to changes in naming.
    * The refactoring was not done correctly in certain places, resulting in unexpected changes in file names which made it seem like we lost certain essential files.

* Dealing with time delay due to different and clashing schedules of each team member.

* Forking workflow made working on the project at the same time inefficient, especially when multiple members were working on the same file.

### Effort required
When this projects work was compared to the amount of effort needed for the IP, it can be said that the same amount of effort
if not more was put into this project as compared to the IP. We believe we put in 160% of the effort each one of us put into our IP and that's a conservative estimate. This project required all members working around the clock
and a high amount of effort was used to achieve weekly deliverables and ensure a working product was available at all times. 

### Achievements
* UI redesigned to match a more aesthetically pleasing and purposeful look.
* Additional features for extra functionality , such as ability to record the particular grades for individual students,
  the ability to sort the list of students based on our students' attributes,
  the ability to mark mastery checks as done or undone,
  the ability to add alias for commands,
* Addition of new tests for the new commands.
* Greater understanding of real world software engineering practices.
* Greater appreciation for teamwork and timeliness.
