### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/travelr/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/travelr/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`, which is used to delete a trip at the specified index.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same title as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/travelr/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TripListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/travelr/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Trip` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/travelr/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TravelrParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a trip).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TravelrParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command title e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TravelrParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/travelr/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the Travelr data i.e., 
  - all `Trip` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTripList` object)
  - all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object)
* stores the currently 'selected' `Trip` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Trip>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Event` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Event>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/travelr/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Travelr data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TravelrStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.travelr.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Display trip's events

#### Implementation
The proposed display trip's events mechanism is facilitated by the `SelectCommand` through the use of an `EventInItineraryPredicate`.
It extends `Predicate` with a test that checks if an event is part of the given Itinerary, which is stored
internally as an `Itinerary`. This predicate is then set as the predicate of the `filteredEventList`, which
contains all events added to Travelr.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the display trip's events mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Travelr` will be initialised with the
initial Travelr state.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/Trip to Japan ...` to add a new trip, and also executes `add-e n/Try Takoyakis ...`
to add a new event to Travelr.

Step 3. The user adds the `Event` 'Try Takoyakis' to the `Trip` titled 'Trip to Japan', which results in 'Try Takoyakis'
being in its `Itinerary`.

Step 4. The user executes the `select 1` command to display the 1st trip's events.
A new `EventInItineraryPredicate` will be created, with an internal `Itinerary` pointer that points to the `Itinerary`
of the selected `Trip`. `Model#updateFileredEvents` will then be called with the predicate supplied as an argument,
which will update the list of displayed events to be those that are part of the selected trip's itinerary.


The following sequence diagram shows how the select operation works:
![SelectSequenceDiagram](images/SelectSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:
![SelectActivityDiagram](images/SelectActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Format of display trip's events command:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use index as arguments
    * Pros: Will be easier for the user to look at/remember the index and use the command.
    * Cons: Comparatively more error prone.
   
* **Alternative 2:** Use trip title as arguments.
    * Pros: Given the previous code structure, easy and fast to implement. Less error prone in term of user mistakes.
    * Cons: Creates many dummy Objects. In entering the command, using the exact trip's titles' name can be harder and time-consuming for the user.

### \[Implemented\] Add event to trip

#### Implementation
The proposed add event to trip mechanism is facilitated by the use of `AddEventToTripCommand`.
It extends `Command` with some tests that checks the event and trip. 

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the add event to trip's mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Travelr` will be initialised with the
initial Travelr state.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/Trip to Japan ...` to add a new trip, and also executes `add-e n/Try Takoyakis ...`
to add a new event to Travelr.

Step 3. The user executes `add-et n/Try Takoyakis t/Trip to Japan`, which adds the `Event` 'Try Takoyakis' to the `Trip` titled 'Trip to Japan', which results in 'Try Takoyakis'
being in its `Itinerary`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** For the command to work normally, the specified `Event` need to be in the bucket list and the `Trip` should exist in the trip list

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the Add Event To Trip command works:
![AddEventToTripSequenceDiagram](images/AddEventToTripSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Format of add event to trip command:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses event and trip title as arguments
    * Pros: Given the previous code structure, easy and fast to implement. Less error prone in term of user mistakes.
    * Cons: Creates many dummy Objects. In entering the command, using the exact titles' name can be harder and time-consuming for the user.

* **Alternative 2:** Uses event and trip index as shown in the GUI.
  itself.
    * Pros: Will be easier for the user to look at/remember the index and use the command.
    * Cons: Comparatively more error prone regarding the argument provided compared to the previous alternative. 


### \[Implemented\] Display completed trips and events


#### Implementation
The display completed trips and events mechanism is facilitated by the use of `EventCompletedPredicate`
and `TripCompletedPredicate`. `TripCompletedPredicate` and `EventCompletedPredicate` extends `Predicate` with
a test that checks if an event is part of a list of itineraries belonging to completed trips.

These predicates are then set as the predicate of the `filteredTripList` and `filteredEventList` respectively, which will result
in the display of completed trips and events.

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the display trip's events mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. `Travelr` will be initialised with the
initial Travelr state.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/Trip to Japan ...` to add a new trip, and also executes `add-e n/Try Takoyakis ...`
to add a new event to Travelr.

Step 3. The user adds the `Event` 'Try Takoyakis' to the `Trip` titled 'Trip to Japan', which results in 'Try Takoyakis'
being in its `Itinerary`.

Step 4. The user executes `mark 1`, which marks the first trip as well as the events in its itinerary as completed.

Step 5. The user executes `completed`, which displays all completed trips and events, which includes both 'Trip to Japan'
and 'Try Takoyakis'.

The following sequence diagram shows how the completed command works:

<img src="images/ViewCompletedSequenceDiagram.png" width="650" />

### \[Implemented\] Display Travelr Summary Window
#### Implementation

The summary command is facilitated by `SummaryVariables`. It contains several fields which are the `property` representing statistics of the Travelr app that will displayed to the user in the Summary Window.

Here are some key properties 
* `tripsProgress` --- A `SimpleStringProperty` which has a `String` value representing the percentage of trips completed.
* `eventsProgress` --- A `SimpleStringProperty` which has a `String` value representing the percentage of trips completed.
* `totalUniqueLocations` --- A `SimpleIntegerProperty` which has an `Integer` value representing the total unique locations a User visited.

These methods added to the `ModelManager` helps to manage the `SummaryVariables`.

* `ModelManager#getSummaryVariables()`â€‰â€” Returns the `SummaryVariables` stored in the `ModelManager`.
* `ModelManager#refreshSummaryVariables()`â€‰â€” Refreshes the `SummaryVariables`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the summary mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Travelr` will be initialized with the initial Travelr state.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/Trip Name ...` to add a new trip, and `add-e n/Event Name ...` to add a new event. Throughout the usage of the app, the user adds multiple trips and events to Travelr, and also uses `add-et n/Event Name t/Trip Name ...` to add events to trips. 

Step 3. The user now completes a `Trip` and marks it as completed using the `mark` command. Throughout the usage of the app, the user `mark` multiple trips as he carries out his trips.

Step 4. The user now decides that he wants to see a summary of his travels, and he does so using the `summary` command. The `summary` command will call `Model#refreshSummaryVariables()`,  which calls `SummaryVariables#refresh()` to get new updates for the summary variables and the list of completed trips.

The following sequence diagram shows how the summary command works:

![SummarySequenceDiagram](images/SummarySequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SummaryCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Step 5. Now that the `SummaryVariables` are refreshed, the GUI will display a new window through `MainWindow#handleSummary`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the GUI displays the Summary Window:

![SummaryWindowDiagram](images/SummaryWindowDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How summary executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Show new window.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Poorer user experience from having to change windows.

* **Alternative 2:** Overlay the summary panel over the trips and events panel in the main window.
  * Pros: Easier for users to see the summary information from one window.
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
    
### \[Implemented\] Sorting trips mechanism
#### Implementation

The proposed sorting mechanism is facilitated by `TripComparators`. It contains a few `Comparator<Trip>`used to sort 
the trips by various factors. This mechanism is used in `SortTripsCommand`, `AddCommand`, `MarkTripDoneCommand` and 
`UnmarkDoneTripCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `Travelr` will be initialized with the past app data.

Step 2. The user executes `add n/Trip Name ...` to add a new trip. Throughout the usage of the app, the user adds 
        multiple trips to Travelr. Each time the `add` command is called, the trips are sorted by completion and the
        uncompleted new trips are ordered before the completed trips.

Step 3. The user now completes a `Trip` and marks it as completed using the `mark` command. Throughout the usage of the 
        app, the user `mark` multiple trips as he carries out his trips. Each time the `mark` command is called, the
        trips are sorted by completion and the completed trips are ordered after the uncompleted trips.

Step 4. The user now un-mark a `Trip` and make it incomplete using the `unmark` command. Through the usage of the app,
        the user `unmark` multiple trips as he cancels some of his trips. Each time the `unmark` command is called, the
        trips are sorted by completion and the uncompleted trips are ordered before the completed trips.

Step 5. The user now decides that he wants to sort his list of trips, and he does so using the `sort` command. 
        The `SortTripsCommandParser` firstly parses the command for optional parameters, which may contain the factor 
        to sort by and whether to sort in reverse order. Subsequently, the trips are sorted based on the parameters the 
        user supplied while keeping uncompleted trips ordered before completed trips.
        
The following sequence diagram shows how the `sort` command works:

### Non-Functional Requirements

1.  Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2.  Should be able to hold up to 2000 events without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3.  A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4.  The UI should be resizable as users will likely be referencing other tabs while using this product.
5.  Should respond immediately to user input, as user will likely be using multiple commands.
6.  Should be usable by novice travelers that have never planned a trip.
7.  Should be able to work offline

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **UI**: The User Interface that users will see when they use the product.

## **Appendix: Instructions for Manual Testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   a. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   b. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample trips and events. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   a. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   b. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a trip

1. Deleting a trip while all trips are being shown

   a. Prerequisites: List all trips using the `list` command. Multiple trips in the list.

   b. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First trip is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted trip is shown in the status message. Events in the deleted trip are returned to the bucket list.

   c. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No trip is deleted. Error details shown in the status message.

   d. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.


### Saving data
Travelr data are saved locally automatically after any command.

1. Test case: Data folder is missing

   a. On app launch, if no data folder is detected, a new Travelr instance with sample data will be used. 
   
   b. Run any command and a new data folder containing a travelr.json file will be generated.
   
   c. If you do not run any command and quit the app, no data folder or file will be generated.
  
2. Test case: travelr.json file is missing

   a. On app launch, if there is a data folder but it is empty, a new Travelr instance with sample data will be used.
   
   b. Run any command and a new travelr.json file will be generated in the data folder.
   
   c. If you do not run any command and quit the app, no file will be generated.
   
3. Test case: Data file is corrupted i.e does not follow the correct format

   a. On app launch, if travelr.json file is corrupted, a new Travelr instance with no data will be used.
   
   b. Run any command and the contents of the travelr.json file will be overwritten to contain the new data, which is of a correct format.
   
   c. If you do not run any command and quit the app, no changes will be made to the travelr.json file.
