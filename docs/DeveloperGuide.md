### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/Ui.java) and it's class diagram is shown below

![Structure of UI Component](./images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `EventListPanel`, `PolicyListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

Similarly, the layout of [`PersonListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/PersonListPanel.java), [`PolicyListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/PolicyListPanel.java) and [`EventListPanel`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/EventListPanel.java) are all specified in their respective [`.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view) files.

The layout of [`IncomeGraph`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/ui/IncomeGraph.java) is specified in [`LineGraph.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/LineGraph.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model`, `Policy` and `Event` component, as it displays `Person`, `Policy` and `Event` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/logic/Logic.java) and it's (partial) class diagram is shown below

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/model/Model.java) and its class diagram is shown below

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="750" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the following data
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object)
  * all `Policy` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePolicyList` object)
  * all `Event` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEventList` object)


  <img src="images/ModelPolicyClassDiagram.png" width="500" />



  <img src="images/ModelEventClassDiagram.png"  width="500"/>

* stores the currently 'selected' `XYZ` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<XYZ>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** `XYZ` here refers to either Person, Policy or Event</div>


### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/longtimenosee/storage/Storage.java) and its class diagram is shown below

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both app data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `longtimenosee.commons` package.

# Feature Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

## Client features
### pin and viewPin feature

#### Implementation

Each person object has a boolean attribute known as pinned. When the user pins the person using the index. This attribute will be set to true. When the user pins that same person again, this attribute will be set to false.


* `pin <Index>`â€‰â€”â€‰Sets the boolean pinned attribute to a value of true.
* `pin <Index>`â€‰â€”â€‰If the boolean pinned attribute was previously set true, calling the command again will set it to false.
* `viewPin`â€‰â€”â€‰Uses the predicate PinnedPersonPredicate to sort the full list of existing clients to display only clients with pinned attribute of true.

The following sequence diagram summarizes how pin works:

![PinSequenceDiagram](images/PinSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

Pin activity diagram: <br><br>
<img src="images/PinActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

View pin activity diagram: <br><br>
<img src="images/ViewPinActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How pin and viewPin executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Uses a predicate to sort through pinned clients.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Hard for additional extensions given that this method uses a boolean attribute.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire list of clients pinned.
  * Pros: More potential for further extensions.
  * Cons: May result in performance issues in terms of memory usage.
  
### Sort Feature

#### Implementation

The Sort mechanism is facilitated by `UniquePersonList`, which utilizes Java's `ObservableList` library to store the client list.

The method `FXCollections.sort()` is called by UniquePersonList, which takes in a comparator as an argument and sorts the client list based on the comparator supplied.
Each attribute of a client which is considered a valid sorting metric has its own comparator within its class.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#sort()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `Sort` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1.  The user executes `list` to view his current client list.

Step 2. The user executes `sort income` to view his client list by ascending income levels. This will pass the income comparator to `Model#sort()`. The list will be sorted and changes can be viewed immediately.


The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![Sort Sequence Diagram](./images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user issues a `sort` command:

![Sort Activity Diagram](./images/SortActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to manage saving changes to `Storage`**

As any commands called which modifies the `AddressBook` will save these changes to storage, a major design consideration was whether to save these post-sort changes to the storage

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** save the changes as per normal but provide an option to return to the default sorting view
  * Pros: Easy to implement, less memory required to keep separate original list 
  * Cons: Client list remains in a particular order after `sort` command is called until `sort default` is issued

* **Alternative 2:** keep original list and sorted list as 2 separate lists 
  * Pros: User need not call further command to view original list
  * Cons: More memory to store 2nd list, more difficult to implement 

**Aspect: How to sort list given different metrics** 

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** each sortable class has its own comparator and will be passed as an argument after `sort` command is parsed
  * Pros: Better abstraction and Better OOP 
  * Cons: Comparators must be written for every class  

* **Alternative 2:** `Model` decides how to sort the client list based on sort metric called 
  * Pros: Easier to implement 
  * Cons: less abstraction; information about client attributes will have to be unnecessarily exposed to `Model` class 


## Policy Features

### Assigning clients a policy

#### Implementation

Users can assign existing policies to a client, whilst providing uptake details
such as the premium amount and start/end dates. This is facilitated by the `PolicyAssignCommand` class
and `PolicyAssignCommandParser` classes.

The `PolicyAssignCommandParser` parses the input from the user and identifies which policy has to be assigned to
which client. The appropriate AssignedPolicy object is created with details given in the input 
and is then assigned to the respective client in `PolicyAssignCommand`.

* `Person#addPolicy(assignedPolicy)` - Attempts to add an assigned policy to a set of assigned policies stored within
the person object. It also returns a boolean describing if the assigned policy already exists in the set.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how an `assign` command is executed.

The interactions between the components during the usage scenario is shown in the *Sequence Diagram* below.
The use of `command_details` serves to substitute the command `"assign 1 1 pr/200 sd/2020-10-12 ed/2022-10-12"` for readability. 

<p align="center" >
  <img src="images/AssignPolicySequenceDiagram.png" width="700"/>
</p>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/AssignPolicyActivityDiagram.png" width="800" />


Step 1: The user enters `parse(assign 1 1 pr/200 sd/2020-10-12 ed/2022-10-12)` command to assign the first policy
to the first person. The policy has a yearly premium of $200 and lasts for 2 years, from 2020 to 2022.

Step 2: The `PolicyAssignCommandParser` parses the input and confirm that the indices are valid. 
A `PolicyAssignCommand` object with all parameters is constructed. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** 
Policy and Person indices that are not found in the `UniquePersonList` and `UniquePolicyList` respectively
would be regarded as invalid indices. 
</div>

Step 3: The `PolicyAssignCommand` is executed. The corresponding policy and person objects are retrieved and if not already assigned, the policy is assigned to the person.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Whether to allow users to assign policies to persons using names:**

* **Alternative 1:** Allows assignment using policy/persons names.
  * Pros: More flexible and quicker assigning if user knows exactly who and which policy they want to assign.
  * Cons: More-bug prone, and would require the user to accurately provide the exact name of the policy/person. 
  Hard to get used to for new users, and complicated for established users with lots of clients and policies.

* **Alternative 2: (Current implementation)** Allow assignment using policy/person indices.
  * Pros: Easy to implement and avoids confusion for new users.
  * Cons: Would require the user to check out the list and find out the indices of their target person/policy.
  This is overcome by the functionality of the `find` command, which allows users to filter the lists for specific 
  persons/policies.

### viewIncome feature

#### Implementation

This feature builds on the new policy class created. Where each client has a set of policies assigned to them. In this case, a financial advisorâ€™s income is treated as a class by itself. Where inside the class there are methods of retrieving the income based on different factors stated below.

The main calculation done in class FinancialAdvisorIncome is a function called calculateIncome. This function iterates through a list of clients and for each client, it iterates through the list of policies they have. For each of the policies, LocalDate and Period are used to determine which commission (out of the 3 year differing rates) the assigned policy of the current person is in. Subsequently, all commissions are multiplied by policy premium with the duration of the policy (relative from start date to given date) and summed to give income for a particular year.

* `viewIncome YEAR`â€‰â€”â€‰Invokes the calculation of user's three year income with `YEAR` as the first year via the function .

The following sequence diagram summarizes how viewIncome works:

![ViewIncomeSequenceDiagram](images/ViewIncomeSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

View income activity diagram: <br><br>
<img src="images/ViewIncomeActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How viewIncome executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Encapsulate user's income into a class of its own
    * Pros: By assigning FinancialAdvisorIncome as a class, we are able to add an additional layer of abstraction to deriving the financial advisors income. By doing so, it is easier to utilize the income for other features.
    * Cons: Might pose a problem for retrival of values from class.

* **Alternative 2:** Saves the entire list of clients pinned.
    * Pros: More potential for further extensions.
    * Cons: May result in performance issues in terms of memory usage.

## Event Features

### AddEventCommand Feature

#### Implementation
The proposed `AddEventCommand` feature is facilitated by the `AddressBook` Model. The `AddressBook` contains information on the list of people and the current events available (i.e: `UniqueEventList` and `UniquePersonList`). The `AddEventParser`  serves as an additional <i>abstraction of logic</i> to determine the validity of an Event on the following conditions, and throws an appropriate exception based on the following conditions.

* Valid Client Name : An event is tagged to a single Client. The Clientâ€™s name must already exist in the `UniqueEventList`. If said person specified does not exist, the `AddEventParser` throws an: `InvalidPersonException`

* No overlapping events: . If the event overlaps with another event (i.e: occurs on the same day, and has a start and end time that coincides with another event in `UniqueEventList`, the `AddEventParser` throws an: `OverlapEventException`.)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `AddEventCommand` behaves at each step.

<B>Step 1</B>. The user launches the application for the first time. The` AddressBook` model is initialized with both the appropriate `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueEventList`. The lists are empty, with a person named `John Williams`.


<B>Step 2</B>. The user adds an event `addEvent desc/ Star Wars Soundtrack n/ John Williams date/2020-01-01 st/12:00 et/13:00`. The event is added successfully.


<B>Step 3</B>. The user then adds a new event `addEvent desc/ JurassicWorld Soundtrack  n/ John Williams date/2020-01-01 st/12:30 et/13:00`. 

* This time window of this event overlaps with the previous event, and the Event List is no longer updated. An `OverlapEventException` is thrown by the parser.


The following activity diagram summarizes how an `AddEventCommand` is parsed at each step.

<p align ="center"> <img src="images/AddEventActivityDiagram.png" width="650" /> </p>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Encapsulation of client vs event:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Event class is a stand-alone class with reference to a Client
    * Pros: Object-Oriented Programming approach, easier to implement, more scalable in handling Event features

* **Alternative 2:** An event becomes an attribute of Client 
    * Pros: Also an intuitive Object-Oriented Programming approach
    * Cons: Difficult and less efficient to implement Event features such as searching

* Alternative 1 was preferred over Alternative 2 due to the following reasons:
    * Easier for testing if it is a separate model 
    * We could make use of a similar implementation for `UniqueEventList` to display events (chronologically) more efficiently

## General Features
### Find feature

#### Implementation

Note: `XYZ` here refers to either Client, Policy or Event

The `findXYZ` mechanism is facilitated by `FilteredList` from JavaFx, by using `FilteredList#setPredicate()` to update the list of XYZ being displayed based on the specified metrics.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `findXYZ` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes a `findXYZ` command to find any clients matching the given metrics. The `findXYZ` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which parses the arguments and calls `FindXYZCommandParser#parse()` with the obtained results

Step 2. `FindXYZCommandParser#parse()` goes through the arguments and check which prefixes are present and creates a `FindXYZCommand` object with the corresponding predicates.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the arguments to the command is invalid, the execution will stop by this step.
</div>

Step 3. `LogicManager` executes the `FindXYZCommand` using the combined predicates, which calls `Model#updateFilteredXYZList()` and updates the list of XYZ displayed

The following sequence diagram shows how the findXYZ operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindXYZCommandParser` and `FindXYZCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a findXYZ command:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How `findXYZ` executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilise predicates and test for each predicate against each contact in the LTNS by making use of `FilteredList`
    * Pros: 
      * Easy extension for additional predicates, by adding predicate classes
      * Lesser user implementation
    * Cons: 
      * If there are too many predicates, there could be an excessive number of classes to manage
      * Lesser control over lower level details of predicate testing

* **Alternative 2:** Take in user defined conditions and test for each person in the LTNS
    * Pros: 
      * More control over lower level details.
      * More efficient algorithms can be used for searching which can improve the overall runtime
    * Cons: 
      * Testing required to ensure that the predicate testing algorithms are implemented correctly
      * Larger overhead in writing code

Alternative 1 was preferred over alternative 2 due to the following reasons:
  * We could make use of `FilteredList` and reduce the amount of additional code that is required.
  * In addition, there is also a greater guarantee on the correctness of the code as compared to if we were to implement our own algorithms
  * Lesser testing overhead, which meant that we can focus more testing on the features implementation and reduce more potential bugs

## Effort

Long Time No See was a highly difficult project to complete.

### Challenges faced, effort required and achievement
To facilitate the functionality required by financial advisors, we first had to conduct research to understand the different
requirements for information they needed. Then, we had to figure out the architecture and interdependencies between pieces of information
to decide how they are represented. This was extremely challenging as we were essentially implementing 3 entire classes on top
of AB3's existing person implementation. Namely, Client (re-implemented person class), Policy and Events. Furthermore, the Policy
class was further expanded into an additional AssignedPolicy class to encapsulate the assignment of policies to a client.

#### Size, multiplied.
The **introduction of multiple entity types** added another layer of complexity in data representation and commands that involved
more than one entity at a time. This can be seen from Events which held references to Clients and in assigned policies which held
references to the Clients and Policies that were relevant.

All in all, this resulted in the commands increasing from **9** (in AB3) to **29** (in LTNS), with the re-implementation of majority of the
9 pre-existing commands and addition of numerous commands of greater complexity and difficulty than the existing commands.

This translated into effort put into creating parsers for each of the 4 main classes as well as test cases for all classes and 
their respective commands. We were able to match the code coverage of the original AB3 at around **~70%** which took a lot of time,
considering the significantly increased amount of code to cover.

#### Going beyond.

Fringe enhancements (though fringe, were not trivial), include implementing the integration of graphical displays through
JavaFX's relevant libraries.

As a cherry on top, we also went the extra mile of a complete UI refresh to give the product a new look and feel, we felt would honour
the professional nature of the product's usage.

Of course, these are the overall end-goals that we were able to meet and achieve. However, this section does not reflect the
effort put into the iterative process and going back to the drawing board numerous times which multiplied the amount of effort
required several fold. The additional challenges faced in between were explicitly left out to keep this section concise.

Hopefully, this provides a good understanding of the effort that went into the product you see today!
