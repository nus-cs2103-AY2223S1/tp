### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of UniNurse.

Given below is a quick overview of the main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/uninurse/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/uninurse/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of UniNurse consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of UniNurse.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of UniNurse in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -p 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/uninurse/ui/Ui.java)

**Description**

The `UI` component manages the user interface of the application so that it responds appropriately to all commands (valid or invalid) that a user inputs.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/uninurse/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

**Components**

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `UI` component:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of 4 crucial parts:

|                   |                                                                                 |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PersonListPanel` | Displays a list of `TruncatedPatientListCard`s that represent `Patient` objects |
| `OutputPanel`     | Displays an output view based on the command executed                           |
| `ResultDisplay`   | Displays the feedback of a command to the user                                  |
| `CommandBox`      | A input field for the user to enter commands into                               |

Other miscellaneous parts (such as `StatusBarFooter`, `HelpWindow`) are also included in the `MainWindow`.

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

Additionally, the structure of `OutputPanel` (simplified in class diagram above) is shown below:
![Structure of the OutputPanel Component](images/OutputPanelClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

`OutputPanel` is a UI part that loads the appropriate view based on the command result. Similar to `MainWindow`, all views and the `OutputPanel` inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class. The `OutputPanel` supports the following views:

|                                               |                                                                                 |
|-----------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `UpdatedPatientCard`                          | Displays details of a `Patient`                                                 |
| `TaskListPanel`                               | Displays the list of tasks of a `Patient`, omitting other `Patient` detail      |
| `TruncatedTaskListPanel`                      | A Truncated view of the list of tasks of all `Patient`s                         |
| `ScheduleListPanel`                           | A Schedule detailing the tasks of the given day and their respective `Patient`s |
| `UpdatedPersonListPanel`                      | Displays a list of `UpdatedPatientCard`s after using a `find` command           |
| `UndoCard`, `RedoCard`, `ModifiedPatientCard` | Displays the outcome of an `undo`/`redo` command                                |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Functionality**

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` or `Patient` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/uninurse/logic/Logic.java)

**Description**

The `Logic` component handles the execution of the user input. It manages the parsing of the user input to decide the type of command to be executed.

**Components**

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `UninurseBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser`, which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object which the `UninurseBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** `XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name (e.g., `AddPatientCommandParser`, `AddPatientCommand`, etc.)

</div>

**Functionality**

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `UninurseBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPatientCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -p 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -p 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifelines for `DeleteGenericCommandParser` and `DeletePatientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifelines reaches the end of diagram.

</div>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/uninurse/model/Model.java)

**Description**

The `Model` component stores and handles the UniNurse data. The data in this component is represented by objects that simulate real-life entities and the associations between these entities.

**Components**

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Model` component:

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the UniNurse book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all of its saved versions.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* depends on the other three components in the following manner: `UninurseBookSnapshot` stores a copy of the `CommandResult` after a snapshot is made, to be retrieved by the `Ui` component when an `undo`/`redo` command is executed.
* each patient has a `TaskList`, which holds `Task` which can be NonRecurringTasks or RecurringTasks. The below Class diagram illustrates their relationship.
  
<img src="images/TaskClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/uninurse/storage/Storage.java)

**Description**

The `Storage` component saves and stores UniNurse data in a JSON file format. It also reads the stored data back into UniNurse.

**Components**

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both Uninurse book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `UninurseBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.uninurse.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Task viewing feature

#### Implementation

The viewing of tasks that are associated with patients can be achieved using the following 2 commands.

* `listTask` to list all tasks associated to all patients.
* `viewTask PATIENT_INDEX` to list task associated to the patient at the specified `PATIENT_INDEX`.

<br>

The `listTask` command is executed when the user enters the command into the UI which is handled by `ListTaskCommand`. Note that the command does not accept any arguments, hence there is no need for a `ListTaskCommandParser` to be created.

The change is reflected in the UI by calling `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` with the predicate that returns true if a patient in the list has associated tasks. This currently only updates the patient list panel to display patients that have associated tasks and does not update the output panel. (Future implementations would update the output panel to display all tasks associated with all patients.)

The following sequence diagram illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` component when the command is being executed.

<img src="images/ListTaskSequenceDiagram.png" width="500" />

<br>

The `viewTask` command is executed when the user enters the command into the UI which is handled by `ViewTaskCommand`. Since the command requires an argument `PATIENT_INDEX`, a `ViewTaskCommandParser` is created to determine the validity of the arguments provided. Given that valid arguments are provided, the command is then executed in the following manner.

1. The `Patient` at the specified `PATIENT_INDEX` is retrieved from the `lastShownList` obtained from the `Model` component.
1. The `Model` component updates its current list with `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` to display only the specified `Patient`.
1. The `UI` component updates its result display by displaying the feedback message from `ViewTaskCommand`.
1. The `UI` component updates its output panel by displaying a `TaskListPanel`.

Note that `TaskListPanel` only displays the complete list of tasks of the specified patient and essential information such as the patient name and tags.

The following sequence diagrams illustrate the interactions between the `UI`, `Logic` and `Model` component when the command is being executed.

<img src="images/ViewTaskSequenceDiagram1.png" width="900" />

<img src="images/ViewTaskSequenceDiagram2.png" width="500" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Viewing tasks on a particular day feature

#### Implementation

The `view` command when no flags are present, parses the user input and generates a `TasksOnCommand` object which has a `DateTime` object containing the date the user wants the tasks for. 
When the command is executed, it sets the model to show only the tasks on the day of interest.

The Sequence diagram below shows the execution of a view command with no flags.

![tasksOnSequenceDiagram](images/TasksOnSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Multi-valued attributes feature

A multi-valued attribute is a patient details that consists of a list of values. A patient's multi-valued attributes includes tags, tasks, medical conditions, medications and remarks.
Multi-valued attributes are represented by the `Tag`, `Task`, `Condition`, `Medication` and `Remark` classes respectively.

Users can add a multi-valued attribute to a particular patient by providing the following details:
1. The patient's index number shown in the displayed patient list.
2. The attribute to be added.


There are two ways a user can add a multi-valued attribute:
1. Add multiple attributes at one go when the user first creates a patient.
2. Add one attribute at a time to an existing patient.

#### Implementation

A multi-valued attribute is represented by `XYZ`, and multiple attributes are stored internally as a `XYZList`.
`XYZList` facilitates the add/edit/delete multi-valued attribute mechanism, and each patient only has one associated `XYZList`.
`XYZList` mainly implements the following operations:
* `XYZList#add()`: adds a multi-valued attribute to the patient's list of attributes.
* `XYZList#edit()`: edits a multi-valued attribute in the patient's list of attributes.
* `XYZList#delete()`: removes a multi-valued attribute from the patient's list of attributes.

All `XYZList` classes inherit from the `GenericList` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g. during testing.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** `XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific multi-valued attribute type (e.g., `ConditionList`, `Condition`, etc.)

</div>

The activity diagram below summarises the flow of events when a user executes an edit attribute command on a specified patient:

<img src="images/EditXYZActivityDiagram.png" alt="edit_xyz_activity_diagram"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**

The sequence of events when a user executes an add/delete attribute command is similar to edit.

</div>

#### Interactions 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:**

To better illustrate how a multi-valued attribute is added/edited/deleted from a patient, the add/edit/delete condition mechanism is used as an example scenario.
The implementation is similar for the other multi-valued attributes.

</div>

**Add multi-valued attribute**

1. The user executes the `add -p 1 c/Diabetes` command to add a condition to the first patient in the displayed patient list.

2. `UninurseBookParser#parseCommand()` parses the command word `add`, and then creates a corresponding `AddGenericCommandParser` object.

3. `AddGenericCommandParser#parse()` parses flag and option `-p 1`, and then creates a corresponding `AddConditionCommandParser` object.

4. `AddConditionCommandParser#parse()` parses the patient index `1` and the condition `Diabetes` provided, and then creates an `AddConditionCommand` object.

5. The `AddConditionCommand` object interacts with the `Model` to add a condition to the specified patient's condition list.

6. `Logic` returns a `CommandResult` object, which encapsulates the result of the execution of the add condition command.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the Logic component than happen when a user executes the add condition operation:

<img src="images/AddConditionSequenceDiagram.png" alt="add_condition_sequence_diagram"/>

**Edit multi-valued attribute**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit condition mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes the `edit -p 2 -c 1 c/Hypertension` command to edit the first condition of the second patient in the displayed patient list.

2. `UninurseBookParser#parseCommand()` parses the command word `edit`, and then creates a corresponding `EditGenericCommandParser` object.

3. `EditGenericCommandParser#parse()` parses flags and options `-p 2 -c 1`, and then creates a corresponding `EditConditionCommandParser` object.

4. `EditConditionCommandParser#parse()` parses the patient index `2`, the condition index `1` and the condition `Hypertension` provided, and then creates an `EditConditionCommand` object.

5. The `EditConditionCommand` object interacts with the `Model` to replace the desired condition with the newly edited one in the specified patient's condition list.

6. `Logic` returns a `CommandResult` object, which encapsulates the result of the execution of the edit condition command.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the Logic component than happen when a user executes the edit condition operation:

<img src="images/EditConditionSequenceDiagram.png" alt="edit_condition_sequence_diagram"/>

**Delete multi-valued attribute**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete condition mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes the `delete -p 2 -c 1` command to delete the first condition of the second patient in the displayed patient list.

2. `UninurseBookParser#parseCommand()` parses the command word `delete`, and then creates a corresponding `DeleteGenericCommandParser` object.

3. `DeleteGenericCommandParser#parse()` parses flags and options `-p 2 -c 1`, and then creates a corresponding `DeleteConditionCommandParser` object.

4. `DeleteConditionCommandParser#parse()` parses the patient index `2` and the condition index `1` provided, and then creates a `DeleteConditionCommand` object.

5. The `DeleteConditionCommand` object interacts with the `Model` to delete the condition from the specified patient's condition list.

6. `Logic` returns a `CommandResult` object, which encapsulates the result of the execution of the delete condition command.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions within the Logic component than happen when a user executes the delete condition operation:

<img src="images/DeleteConditionSequenceDiagram.png" alt="delete_condition_sequence_diagram"/>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `PersistentUninurseBook`. It consists of a list of `UninurseBookSnapshot`, which itself consists of a `UninurseBook` and a `CommandResult`. `PersistentUninurseBook` stores the saved versions of all `UninurseBook`s, stored internally as:
* `workingCopy`, which is the current (possibly unsaved) version of `UninurseBook`.
* `uninurseBookVersions` and `currentVersion`, which are the saved versions of `UninurseBook`s and which version we last replaced `workingCopy` with.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `PersistentUninurseBook#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)` — Saves the current Uninurse book state (i.e. `workingCopy`) in its history, along with the command result message.
* `PersistentUninurseBook#undo()` — Restores the previous Uninurse book state from its history.
* `PersistentUninurseBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone Uninurse book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, `Model#undo()` and `Model#redo()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `PersistentUninurseBook` will be initialized with the initial Uninurse book state, and the `currentVersion` pointing to that single Uninurse book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete -p 5` command to delete the 5th person in the Uninurse book. The `delete` command calls `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, causing the modified state of the Uninurse book after the `delete -p 5` command executes to be saved in the `uninurseBookVersions` along with the `CommandResult` of the `delete` command, and the `currentVersion` is shifted to the newly inserted Uninurse book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, causing another modified Uninurse book state and the `CommandResult` of the `add` command to be saved into the `uninurseBookVersions`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, so the Uninurse book state will not be saved into the `uninurseBookVersions`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undo()`, which will shift the `currentVersion` once to the left, pointing it to the previous Uninurse book state, and restores the Uninurse book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentVersion` is at index 0, pointing to the initial UninurseBook state, then there are no previous UninurseBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canundo()` to check if this is the case.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redo()`, which shifts the `currentVersion` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the Uninurse book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentVersion` is at index `uninurseBookVersions.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest Uninurse book state, then there are no undone UninurseBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canredo()` to check if this is the case.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the Uninurse book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`, `Model#undo()` or `Model#redo()`. Thus, the `uninurseBookVersions` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#makeSnapshot(CommandResult)`. Since the `currentVersion` is not pointing at the end of the `uninurseBookVersions`, all Uninurse book states after the `currentVersion` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Saves the entire Uninurse book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Display added/edited/deleted patient feature

#### Implementation
Adding/editing/deleting a patient would have a `UpdatedPersonCard` with the patient’s details appear in the `OutputPanel` of the `UI`. The possible commands to achieve this are:
1. add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER e/EMAIL a/ADDRESS [d/TASK_DESCRIPTION]… [t/TAG]…
2. edit -p PATIENT_INDEX
3. delete -p PATIENT_INDEX 

When the user enters any of the above 3 inputs, `UninurseBookParser` parses the inputs and returns the appropriate `Command` (i.e. `AddPatientCommand`, `EditPatientCommand`, or `DeletePatientCommand`) to `LogicManager`. Once the `Command` is executed, the patient is then set as the `patientOfInterest` in the `Model` by calling the `Model#setPatientOfInterest()` method. 

Below is a sequence diagram to show the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` components for **adding a patient** (sequence is similar for editing and deleting a patient):



<img src="images/AddPatientSequenceDiagram3.png"  />

After that, `MainWindow` would call `LogicManager#getPatientOfInterest()` to retrieve the required patient. Thereafter, assuming a patient is added, `MainWindow` calls `OutputPanel#handleAddPatient()` with the patient as a parameter, which would then create a `UpdatedPersonCard` with the patient’s details which appears in the `OutputPanel`.

Below is the sequence diagram which shows the entire interaction between the `UI`, `Logic`, and `Model` components for **adding a patient** (sequence is similar for editing and deleting a patient):
