### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

A quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other is given below.

#### Main components

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

#### Interactions between components

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other in the scenario: user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent external components being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

**API**: [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of the following parts:
* `ResultDisplay`
* `CommandBox`
* `HelpWindow`
* `ProgressBarController`
* `StatusBarFooter`
* `FoodListPanel`

All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in the matching `.fxml` files that
are found in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to data in `Model` so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, as the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays the `Food` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `NutriGoalsParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (specifically: an object of one of its subclasses, e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a food).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `NutriGoalsParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specified command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`). The `XYZCommandParser` object then uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which `NutriGoalsParser` then returns as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />


The `Model` component:

* stores NutriGoals' data, which includes the following:
  * a `FoodList` object that contains all `Food` objects
  * a `List` of `Location` objects, each representing a NUS gym location
  * a `User` object that contains the user's profile details (e.g. height, weight, ideal weight, gender, age, BMI)
  * a `Calorie` object that represents the target calorie intake
  * a `FoodCalorieList` object that contains information about the calorie contents of default food items
  * a `TipList` object that contains `Tip` objects
* stores the currently 'selected' `Food` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list. This filtered list is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Food>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI updates automatically whenever the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (since the `Model` represents data entities in the domain, they
   make sense on their own without depending on other components).

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/nutrigoals/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component:

* can save both NutriGoals data and user preference data in the json format, and read them into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `NutriGoalsStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`. This means that it can be treated as either format (when the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components can be found in the `seedu.nutrigoals.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes the noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Setup feature

#### Implementation

The setup mechanism is facilitated by `SetupCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following
operation:

* `SetupCommand#execute()`: Sets up the user profile.

#### Example usage

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the setup mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user inputs `setup h/170 w/65 i/60 g/m a/20`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`. `NutriGoals#parseCommand()`
is subsequently called, creating a `SetupCommand` object.

Step 3. The `SetupCommand` created is executed by `SetupCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `SetupCommand#execute()` calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#setUserDetails()`
* `Model#getUserDetails()`

Step 5. `SetupCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` which displays the user's information.

The following diagram illustrates how the `setup` operation works.

![SetupSequenceDiagram](./images/SetupSequenceDiagram.png)

### Profile feature

#### Implementation

The profile mechanism is facilitated by `ProfileCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the
following operation:

* `ProfileCommand#execute()`: Retrieves and displays the user's information.

#### Example usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the profile mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application on 19 October 2022.

Step 2. The user executes `profile`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`. `NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is subsequently called, creating a `ProfileCommand` object.

Step 3. The `ProfileCommand` created is executed by `ProfileCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `ProfileCommand#execute()` calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#isUserCreated()`
* `Model#getUserDetails()`

Step 5. `ProfileCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` which displays the user's information.

The following activity diagram outlines the process when the user executes the `ProfileCommand`:

![ProfileCommandActivityDiagram](./images/ProfileCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Edit feature

#### Implementation

The edit mechanism is facilitated by `EditCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `EditCommand#execute()`: Edits the food name, meal type or calories associated with the food at the specified index.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Example usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application on 19 October 2022. Suppose the foods added for the day are:

1. bread: 100 calories, breakfast
2. milk tea: 300 calories, lunch
3. sushi: 500 calories, lunch

Step 2. The user executes `edit 2 n/honey milk tea c/310`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`.
`NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is subsequently called, creating an `EditCommandParser` object.
`EditCommandParser#parse()` is then called to make sense of the arguments supplied by the user.

Step 3. The `EditCommand` is created, and then executed by `EditCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `EditCommand#execute()` calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#setFood(foodToEdit, editedFood)` replaces `foodToEdit` to `editedFood`
* `Model#updateFilteredFoodList(predicate)` filters the food list based on the given predicate

Step 5. `EditCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` with the following result displayed:

```
Food item edited!

Food name: honey milk tea
Calorie content: 310 calories
Meal type: lunch
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following diagram illustrates how the `edit` operation works:

![EditSequenceDiagram](./images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

### List feature

#### Implementation

The list mechanism is facilitated by `ListCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `ListCommand#execute()`: Shows a list of all food items and their respective calories for the specified day (if any).

#### Example usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application on 19 October 2022. NutriGoals initially displays all foods added on the
current day, 19 October 2022.

Step 2. The user executes `list 2022-07-29`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`.
`NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is subsequently called, creating a `ListCommandParser` object.
`ListCommandParser#parse()` is then called to make sense of the date argument supplied by the user.

Step 3. A `ListCommand` object is created with an `IsFoodAddedOnThisDatePredicate` object. The predicate is initialised with 29 July 2022 as the date.

The following object diagram illustrates this.

![ListObjectDiagram](./images/ListObjectDiagram.png)

Step 4. `ListCommand` is then executed by `ListCommand#execute()`, which calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#updateFilteredFoodList(IsFoodAddedOnThisDatePredicate)` filters the food list for foods added on 29 July 2022
* `Model#isFilteredFoodListEmpty()`

Step 5. The filtered food list is shown to the user and `ListCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` with a message
indicating the successful execution of the `list` command.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the `list` command:

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `FindCommand#execute()`: Looks through all previously consumed food items and searches for those whose name matches the predicate. Returns the average calorie content for that particular food item if it is inside the list. If it is not in the list, checks if the food item is in the default list provided, and returns the suggested calorie content from the default list.

#### Example usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application.

Step 2. The user executes `find Banana`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`.
`NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is subsequently called, creating a `FindCommandParser` object.
`FindCommandParser#parse()` is then called to make sense of the food name supplied by the user.

Step 3. A `FindCommand` object is created and then executed by `FindCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. The `FindCommand#execute()` then calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#getFoodCalorieList()`
* `Model#getUnfilteredFoodList()`

Step 5. The `FindCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` that displays the calorie content of the food item specified by the user (which in this case is Banana).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following diagram illustrates how the `find` operation works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

### Target feature

#### Implementation

The target mechanism is facilitated by `TargetCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `TargetCommand#excecute()`: Sets the calorie target for the day.

#### Example usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the target mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application today.

Step 2. The user executes `target 2103`, which calls `LogicManager#execute()`. 
`NutriGoals#parseCommand()` is subsequently called, creating a `TargetCommandParser` object.
`TargetCommandParser#parser()` is then called to make sense of the arguments supplied by the user.

Step 3. The `TargetCommand` is created, and then executed by `TargetCommand#execute()`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Step 4. The `TargetCommand#execute()` calls the following methods from `Model`:
* `Model#setCalorieTarget(calorieTarget)`
* `Model#getCalorieTarget()`

Step 5. `TargetCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` with the following result displayed:

```
Your calorie target set for today: 2103 calories
```

The following diagram illustrates how the `target` operation works:

![TargetSequenceDiagram](./images/TargetSequenceDiagram.png)

### Review feature

#### Implementation

The review mechanism is facilitated by `ReviewCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `ReviewCommand#execute()`: Calculates the total calories, the calorie target and the calorie deficit/surplus for the current day.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Example usage

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the review mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application on 19 October 2022. Suppose the foods added for the day are:

1. bubble tea: 232 kcal
2. chicken rice: 702 kcal
3. wanton noodles: 409 kcal

Step 2. The user executes `review` command, creating a `ReviewCommand` object. 

Step 3. The `ReviewCommand` created is executed by `ReviewCommand#execute()`. 

Step 4. `ReviewCommand#execute()` creates an `IsFoodAddedOnThisDatePredicate` object with 19 October 2022 as the date.

Step 5. `ReviewCommand#execute()` then calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#updateFilteredFoodList(IsFoodAddedOnThisDatePredicate)` filters the food list for foods added on 19 October 2022
* `Model#getTotalCalorie()`
* `Model#getCalorieTarget()`
* `Model#getCalorieDifference()`

Step 6. `ReviewCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` with the following information displayed to the user:

```
Your calorie intake for today: 1343 calories
Your calorie target for today: 2000 calories
You should consume 657 more calories to reach your calorie target for today!
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the `review` operation works:

![ReviewSequenceDiagram](images/ReviewSequenceDiagram.png)

### Suggest feature

#### Implementation

The suggest mechanism is facilitated by `SuggestCommand`, which extends `Command`. It overrides the following operation:

* `SuggestCommand#execute()`: Calculates a suggested amount of calories a user should consume per day.

#### Example usage

The following illustrates what objects are created when `suggest` is executed.

![SuggestObjectDiagram](images/SuggestObjectDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the suggest mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application today.

Step 2. The user executes `suggest` command, creating a `SuggestCommand` object.

Step 3. The `SuggestCommand` created is executed by `SuggestCommand#execute()`.

Step 4. `SuggestCommand#execute()` then calls the following methods from `Model`:

* `Model#isUserCreated()`
* `Model#calculateSuggestedCalorie()`

Step 5. `SuggestCommand#execute()` returns a `CommandResult` that displays an estimated suggested amount of calories the user should consume per day.

The following activity diagram outlines what happens when a user executes the `suggest` command:

![SuggestActivityDiagram](images/SuggestActivityDiagram.png)

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 foods without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be
   able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. The system should respond to a command within two seconds.
5. Project scope:

### Glossary

* **Calorie(s)**: Unit of measurement for amount of food consumed.

* **Daily Recommended Calorie Intake**: The amount of calories recommended by experts for an individual to consume daily (According to Health Promotion Board Singapore, adult males should consume 2200 calories, adult females should consume 1800 calories).

* **Deficit**: The negative difference between the calories consumed in a day and the target daily intake. These calories are _not_ consumed to facilitate weight loss and fat burn.

* **Food item**: Refers to an individual item of food that is consumed by the user.

* **Gym**: Refers to a gymnasium used for weight training.

* **Ideal weight**: The self-defined weight that users want to achieve for themselves.

* **Meals**: Breakfast, Lunch, Dinner e.t.c., categories that consist of multiple food items and is usually consumed at a particular time.

* **Surplus**: The positive difference between the calories consumed in a day and the target daily intake. These calories are consumed to facilitate weight gain and muscle growth.

## Appendix: Effort

When we embarked on this project, NutriGoals was projected to be a morph of the original AB3 application.
It would be a complete wraparound where even the base purpose was different - from an address book to a calorie tracker.
This design decision then lead to many hiccups along the way, but they were nonetheless instrumental in teaching us about
good software engineering practices that we need moving ahead.

Initially, the choice to morph the application led to the refactoring of the codebase to suit our purpose. This
unfortunately caused certain bugs and many errors in not just the test cases, but also the core program itself. While this
was troublesome, confusing and tedious, it allowed us to understand the code base on a deeper level and we were able to appreciate
certain software engineering skills (such as defensive coding).

Another major hiccup and learning lesson came from designing features that not only work, but also suit the user needs. We
admittedly had some trouble coming up with ideas for new features to implement. Eventually, using customer-oriented thinking,
we were able to come up with unique and useful features to add, which we did so successfully. Yet again, we were able to practice
the skills taught extensively as we tried to code comprehensively and defensively, and come up with test cases to ensure extensive
coverage of our code.

To summarise, while the project itself was arduous with multiple setbacks, we were successful in developing an application that
is both useful and easy-to-use for users. Additionally, as mentioned, we were able to put into practice what we had learnt as 
software engineering students and develop a product with good software engineering practices.
