## **1. Introduction**

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the architecture and software design decisions for our CLI-based task management app NotionUS.
While the document is in general for anyone who wants to understand the system, it is primarily targeted towards the
designers, developers and software testers of notionUS.

### 1.2 Scope
As the goal of this document is to cover and explain the architecture and design decisions, we first discuss
the high-level architecture and software design under the "Design" section. Then we go into details of
implementation of our features in the "Implementation" section.

## **4. Design**

### 4.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#46-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#42-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#43-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#44-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#45-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TaskListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter`, `FilterStatusDisplay` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the
abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder, except for `MainWindow`. The layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`NotionUSMainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/NotionUSMainWindow.fxml)
.
An FXML variable declared in the Java Class must correspond to the fxml component with the same FX ID.

The layout of `TaskCard` has been edited to fit the look of a task in Notion, especially the behaviour of task cards
when resizing the main window. The CSS of the app is specified
in [`NotionUS.css`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/NotionUS.css).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified task data and if applicable, any
  filters applied on the tasklist.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Task` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TaskListParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a task).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TaskListParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TaskListParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 4.4 Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the task list data i.e., all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the archived `Task` objects in another `UniqueTaskList` object.
* stores the filter status when the task list is filtered and also updates when the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For the `Task` class,
* to support a default sorting of `Task` objects, `Task` implements the `Comparable<Task>` interface
* As `Deadline` is an optional field, their values are stored in an `Optional` object.

### 4.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/TaskList-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram-0.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `TaskListStorage`, `ArchivedTaskListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### 4.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.TaskList.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **5. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 5.1 Archive Command

A user is able to archive a task when a task is completed or has been due. This helps to reduce clutter whenever a user enters the command.
Archived tasks will be stored and can be retrieved using `showarchive`.

Command takes input

* `archive TASK_NUMBER` where `TASK_NUMBER` is the index of the tasks based on the displayed index shown in Main Window.

Command result will if the task is archived successfully. Should there be a duplicate of the same task in the archived task list. The new archived task will be removed from current task list.

Should the `TASK_NUMBER` entered is out of bound, a generic CommandResult and an error message
will be given. Model will not be updated.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Below is the sequence diagram for an execution of `archive TASK_NUMBER`, assuming `TASK_NUMBER` is not out of bound.

![Sequence diagram when command `archive 1` is executed](images/ArchiveSequenceDiagram-0.png)

The above sequence diagram shows how the archive command works when user input `archive 1` is entered.
It first parses the index of the task to archive to retrieve the task. Next, it removes the task from the task list and adds it to the archived task list.

Archive command is facilitated by the `ArchivedTaskList`. `ArchivedTaskList` does not allow the user to modify or edit the tasks stored in archived task list.

The addition of `ArchivedTaskList` requires a separate storage system for the archived tasks, which forms under `ArchivedTaskListStorage`.
The .json file for archived task is named as `archivedTaskList.json`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.2 Mark/unmark feature

#### Implementation

The mark/unmark feature marks a task in the task list as done/not done respectively. Its mechanism is facilitated
by `MarkCommand` and `UnmarkCommand`. They both extend `Command`, overriding the `execute` method.
The implementation of `mark` and `unmark` is such that a task being marked or unmarked is effectively replaced by an
identical task with a modified `isDone` field in the task list.

Below is the sequence diagram for an execution of `mark <index>`, assuming `<index>` is not out of bounds.

![Sequence diagram when command `mark 1` is executed](images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.3 List feature

#### 5.3.1 Implementation

The list feature filters the displayed task list based on the filters entered by user. Its mechanism is facilitated by `ListCommand` and `ListCommandParser`, as well as their subclasses (E.g. `ListDeadlineCommand`, `ListDeadlineCommandParser`).

Multiple filters can be applied in a single `ListCommand`. For example, `ls -u --module CS2103T` would list all tasks that are unmarked and under the `Module` "CS2103T".

`ListCommand` extends `Command`, overriding the `execute` method. To allow for multiple filters, the constructor of `ListCommand` takes in `List<Predicate<Task>>`.
The list of predicates will subsequently be reduced into a single predicate.

This table summarizes the respective flags that users can use to apply filters of their choice.

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**
Words in `UPPER_CASE` are values of parameters to be supplied by the user
</div>

| Flag        | Effect                                          | Format                        |
|-------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------|
| `-a`        | List all tasks                                  | `ls -a`                       |
| `-u`        | List all unmarked tasks                         | `ls -u`                       |
| `-m`        | List all marked tasks                           | `ls -m`                       |
| `--module`* | List all tasks under the same module            | `ls --module MODULE`          |
| `-t`*       | List all tasks containing the same tag          | `ls -t TAG`                   |
| `-d`*       | List all tasks with deadline on or after a date | `ls -d DATE`                  |
| `-n`*       | List all task names with the matching keywords  | `ls -n KEYWORD`               |

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="block" class="alert alert-info">
**:information_source: Note:**
Flags that are labelled with a `*` are commands that expect a parameter, as seen in the Format column. <br>
These commands have a corresponding `Parser` that implements `Parser<ListModuleCommand>` to parse the parameter passed in. Each `Parser` implements the `parse` method in `Parser` interface. In which, validity checks are conducted. <br>
Example:
* In `ListDeadlineCommandParser`, argument is verified to contain only numbers in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
</div>

This feature uses the following methods from the `Model` interface:
* `Model#updateFilteredTaskList`: Updates the current task list by applying a filter as indicated by the given predicate `Predicate<Task>`. The GUI will be updated accordingly to display the filtered task list.
* `Model#updateFilterStatus`: Updates the list of filters that have been applied to the current task list displayed. This will be reflected on the GUI.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 5.3.2 Usage scenario

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step to execute the `ls -u --module CS2103T` command. 

**Step 1.** The user enters `ls -u --module CS2103T` to filter out tasks that are unmarked and under the `Module` "CS2103T".

**Step 2.** `LogicManager` calls the `TaskListParser#parseCommand(String)` method. A new `ListCommandParser` object is created and returned.

**Step 3.** `TaskListParser` calls the `ListCommandParser#parse(String)` method. `ListCommandParser` self-invocates `ListCommandParser#getPredicate(String)` for each flag found (i.e. `-u`, `--module`).

**Step 4.** `ListCommandParser#getPredicate("-u")` directly returns an instance of `TaskIsDonePredicate` as the `-u` flag does not expect a parameter.

**Step 5.** Meanwhile, `ListCommandParser#getPredicate("--module CS2103T")` returns an instance of `ListModuleCommandParser` as the `--module` flag expects a parameter, that has to be parsed.

**Step 6.** `ListCommandParser` calls `ListModuleCommandParser#getPredicate(String)` method. A new instance of `ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate` is created and returned.

**Step 7.** A new `ListCommand` instance is instantiated. Both predicates, `TaskIsDonePredicate` from **Step 4** and `ListModuleCommandPredicate` from **Step 6** are passed into the `ListCommand` constructor. `ListCommand` instance is returned to `LogicManager`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Below is the sequence diagram for the partial execution of `ls -u --module CS2103T` up till **Step 7**.

![Partial sequence diagram when command `ls -u --module CS2103T` is executed](images/ListSequenceDiagram1-0.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 8.** `LogicManager` calls the `ListCommand#execute()` method.

**Step 9.** The two predicates passed in are reduced into one `predicate`. The current `taskList` is updated by calling `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(predicate)`.

**Step 10.** `Model#updateFilterStatus(String)` is called twice to update the list of filters being applied to the current displayed `taskList`.

**Step 11.** A new `CommandResult` object is returned, signifying that command execution was successful.

Below is the sequence diagram for the partial execution of `ls -u --module CS2103T` from **Step 8** to **Step 11**.

![Partial sequence diagram when command `ls -u --module CS2103T` is executed](images/ListSequenceDiagram2.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.4 Find feature

The `find` feature is similar to the list feature as it is also a filter on the current task list. The find feature finds
any task name that contains the keyword(s) and any tags that match the keyword(s) given.

`FindCommand` extends `Command`, overriding the `execute` method.

This feature uses the following methods from the `Model` interface:
* `Model#updateFilteredTaskList`: Updates the current task list by applying a filter as indicated by the given predicate `Predicate<Task>`. The GUI will be updated accordingly to display the filtered task list.
* `Model#updateFilterStatus`: Updates the list of filters that have been applied to the current task list displayed. This will be reflected on the GUI.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 5.4.1 Usage Scenario

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mechanism behaves at each step to execute the `find tutorial priority` command.

**Step 1.** The user enters `find tutorial priority` to find all tasks with names containing and tags matching `tutorial` and `priority`.

**Step 2.** `LogicManager` calls the `TaskListParser#parseCommand(String)` method. A new `FindCommandParser` object is created and returned.

**Step 3.** `TaskListParser` calls the `FindCommandParser#parse(String)` method.

**Step 4.** `FindCommandParser#parse(String)` returns a new instance of `FindCommand` with a `NameOrTagContainsKeywordsPredicate` and returned to `LogicManager`.

**Step 5.** `LogicManager` calls the `FindCommand#execute()` method.

**Step 6.** The current `taskList` is updated by calling `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(predicate)`.

**Step 7.** `Model#updateFilterStatus(String)` is called to update the filter being applied to the current displayed `taskList`.

**Step 8.** A new `CommandResult` object is returned, signifying that command execution was successful.

Here is a sequence diagram to represent the execution of the command:

![Sequence diagram when command `find tutorial priority` is executed](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.5 Returning to a previous command

#### 5.5.1 Implementation

This feature allows the user to traverse through past commands via the `up` and `down` keys on the keyboard, similar to how
it works in a terminal.

This mechanism of returning to previous commands is facilitated by `CommandHistory`. It works with `CommandBox`, storing
entered commands internally in `previousCommands` and controls the traversal with the aid of `pointer`.
* `previousCommands` â€“ An [ArrayList](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/ArrayList.html) storing `String`s
* `pointer` - An `int` variable that points to a `String` in `previousCommands`

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CommandHistory#add(String)` â€“ Saves the entered command into the history.
* `CommandHistory#up()` â€“ Traverses upwards through the history and restores the previously entered command.
* `CommandHistory#down()` â€“ Traverses downwards through the history and restores the command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 5.5.2 Usage scenario

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the command history traversal mechanism behaves at each step.

**Step 1.** The user launches the application for the first time. The `CommandBox` will be initialised, which in turns
initialises the `CommandHistory` that is contained within. Since command history is empty, `previousCommands` will be
empty.

![State diagram 0 of up/down key](images/UpDownState0.png)

**Step 2.** The user enters a command `ls -u`. Upon entering a new
command, `CommandBox#handleButtonPressed(KeyEvent)` is called, which in turn calls `CommandHistory#add(String)` to
stores this command into `previousCommands`.

![State diagram 1 of up/down key](images/UpDownState1-0.png)

**Step 3.** The user presses on the `up` key to return to the previously entered command. This action calls
the `CommandHistory#up()` which will shift `pointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous command in history,
and feeds this String `ls -u` back to the command box.

![State diagram 2 of up/down key](images/UpDownState2.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 4.** The user enters another command `mark 1`. Through the same mechanism as in Step 1, this command will be stored into `previousCommands`.
`pointer` will be reset to the last position. 

![State diagram 3 of up/down key](images/UpDownState4.png)

**Step 5.** The user presses on the `down` key to traverse down the history. This action calls the `CommandHistory#down()` method
which will shift `pointer` once to the right. Since the `pointer` is pointing outside of the arrayList, there is no command to be restored. 
Hence, the command box will be cleared.

![State diagram 3 of up/down key](images/UpDownState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user clicks on the `up`/`down` keys.

![Activity diagram of up/down key](images/UpDownKeyActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 5.5.3 Design considerations:

**Aspect: How command history is stored:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores entered commands in an arrayList, renewed everytime the app launches.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Will not be able to restore commands from previous launches.
* **Alternative 2:** Stores entered commands into a local `json` file.
    * Pros: Will be able to restore commands from previous launches.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement as storage architecture will have to be renewed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.6 Command autocomplete feature

#### 5.6.1 Implementation

This feature allows the user to traverse through a drop-down list of possible commands that can be used, and is updated
as they are typing. This provides convenience for the user as he can click `Enter` to complete the command after
selection.

The mechanism works by firstly having a list of possible commands. This list is then filtered with the condition 
of whether any of them contain the text that the user is inputting at real-time. This filtered list is then shown as a 
JXML context menu below the command box.

It adds the following methods in CommandBox.java:

* `CommandBox#handleAutoComplete` â€“ Handles the filtering of the command list and showing the suggestions list.
* `CommandHistory#populatePopUp` â€“ Populates the suggestions list popup with the filtered list.

Below is an example usage scenario for autocomplete:

**Step 1.** The user opens the app, which initialises the `CommandBox` which then initialises the `ContextMenu` and a
`CommandList` of all the possible commands that be used in the app.

**Step 2.** The user would like to edit a task that has in NotionUS, and knows that the command begins with an `e`, typing
it into the command box. A list of possible commands appears as a popup `ContextMenu` below the
command box, containing the commands of `edit` and `exit`.

**Step 3.** When the popup appears, the user can use the `up` and `down` key to traverse the list to the command of choice.
Once the user would like to use that command, the user hits `Enter` and the command is filled into the command box.
This closes the popup.

**Step 4.** The user adds the required additional information if required and then hits `Enter` to perform the command as per normal.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Below is an activity diagram to display how the feature works:

![AutocompleteActivityDiagram](images/AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png)

#### 5.6.2 Design considerations:

**Aspect: Filtering commandList to find matching commands:**

* **Alternative 1: (current implementation)** Filters command list down everytime the user input changes.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Inefficient as full list is filtered every time.
* **Alternative 2:** Filter the current command list if the start of current input matches start of commands already
in previous list.
  * Pros: Harder to implement.
  * Cons: Efficient especially when command list is large.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.7 [Proposed] Acceptance of Multiple Date Formats

#### 5.7.1 Current Implementation

Currently, the `Deadline` class only accepts dates in the ISO 8601 format (e.g. 2022-11-07), which is unnatural for new
users to type. Accepting multiple date formats will be much appreciated by the user base.

#### 5.7.2 Proposed Implementation

A list of accepted formats generated using `DateTimeFormatter::ofPattern` needs to be stored as a static field in 
`Deadline`. 

Assuming the input is not null, we first do what we are doing currently and parse using `LocalDate::parse`, checking
for an exception. This will check for the ISO 8601 format. Next, for each accepted format `format`, we try parsing the
input again using `LocalDate.parse(input, format)`. If all of them fail, then we know that the input is invalid.

One can go further as to allow keying in of dates without the year. In such a case, we will have to use 
`java.time.MonthDay::parse` instead of `LocalDate::parse`. This, however, presents an issue for our `Deadline` class as 
we are using a `LocalDate` internally, which requires a year. A solution to this is to assume that the provided 
`MonthDay` refers to a day in the current year. For example, say the current year is 2022, if the user 
provides 20/11, the date should be parsed as 20 November 2022.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows what will happen with the proposed implementation of multiple date formats:

![ProposedDeadlineSequenceDiagram](images/ProposedDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png)

#### 5.7.3 Alternative Implementations

**Aspect: Providing a year for Month and Day only inputs**

* Alternative 1 (mentioned above): The current year is taken
  * Pros: Easy to implement
  * Cons: The feature may become frustrating to use in December when planning for tasks in Janurary
* Alternative 2: Provide a year such that the resultant date is after the current date.
  * For example, if the current date is 20 Nov 2022 and the user provides 10 Nov, the result will be 10 Nov 2023.
  * Pros: Resolves the December problem of alternative 1
  * Cons: The edge case of 29 February needs to be considered, and putting deadlines before the current date may be more difficult
* Alternative 3: Provide a year such that the resultant date is either three months before or nine months after the current date
  * Pros: More user-friendly and is most likely what the user expects when typing the command
  * Cons: More complicated implementation


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 5.8 [Proposed] Aliasing of Commands

#### 5.8.1 Rationale for Feature

As users become more familiar with the command line, some may prefer to have aliases for commonly used commands to
improve their efficiency. For example, instead of typing `add -n Project ...` every time, a user may prefer to just type 
`a Project ...` to quickly add in a task, where `a` is an alias for `add -n`. Other potential uses are aliases for 
commonly used list filters, instead of typing the whole command out.

#### 5.8.2 Proposed Implementation

The addition of the alias feature will require the following commands:

* View all current aliases: `alias`
* Add alias: `alias ALIAS_NAME -c COMMAND_TO_RUN`, with a limitation that ALIAS_NAME has no spaces
* Delete alias: `unalias ALIAS_NAME`

The proposed aliasing mechanism will be facilitated by a `AliasList` class that encapsulates a `HashMap`, which
stores the alias name and the command to replace the alias. The `AliasList` class will be part of the Model component
amd will contain the following methods:

* `AliasList#addAlias(String alias, String command)` - Adds an alias
* `AliasList#deleteAlias(String alias)` - Delete an alias
* `AliasList#getCommand(String alias)` - Returns the actual command to be run if the provided input is an alias, else it
  simply returns the input.
* `AliasList#listAliases()` - Returns a list of aliases

These operations will be exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model::addAlias`, `Model::deleteAlias`, 
`Model::getCommand` and `Model::listAliases` respectively.

`LogicManager` will work to ensure that the contents of `AliasList` is stored persistently on disk.

Since aliases can only be one word (by our restriction in the add alias command), we only need the first word of a 
command to check whether it is an alias. If it is, the alias will be replaced with the actual command to be run.

Below is the sequence diagram for an execution of `a Project -m CS2103T`, with `a` being an alias for `add -n`.

To prevent the `alias` and `unalias` commands from being inaccessible due to a bad alias, eg `alias alias -c bad`, those
two commands cannot be aliased.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an alias command:

## **9. Appendix: Effort**
For the effort, we felt that our group have placed more than the average. We dissected and analysed the problem of our target audience. 
From there, we generated an extensive list of user stories to decide on the features to be included in our application.  

Our group morphed the model from `Person` to `Task`, the challenging part is to refactor all the various classes and fields. We also had to change of the various syntax of `module`, `Deadline` etc.
This caused a lot of test cases to fail which we have to fix. For `Deadline`, we took the extra effort to make it optional to improve the usability for our users.

Another challenge that was faced was understanding the `LogicManager` and `ModelManager` as we add in more commands. This requires us to apply the OOP principle and read up on the various APIs that we are 
not familiar with such as `ObservableList`.  

While we were adding the archive command, we have added a separate storage file for the `ArchivedTaskList` to separate it from the current task list as we do not want it to be modified or changed at this stage. 
A lot of time was taken to understand how the addressBook storage works such as how the JSON file was created and saved. Due to creation of the new `ArchiveTaskList` class, we have to add in new methods to `LogicManager` and `ModelManager` and 
the relevant interfaces, which resulted in many existing test cases to fail.  

For the UI, we took the extra effort to change the appearance so that it is easy on the eyes. Since we did not have much experience dealing with CSS files and JavaFx, and on top of that it was different from what we have learnt, hence 
we had read up and try for ourselves. Experimenting with the various fonts and editing size of the windows and make changes to fit in our new features was foreign to us as well, which caused us extra time to tackle it.
