### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components:
* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor and handles autocomplete.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Handles reading and writing data to the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png"/>

Each of the four main components will:

* Define its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Implement its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class, which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class. This is to prevent the outside component being coupled to the implementation of a component, as illustrated in the partial class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png"/>

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, e.g.,`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the [JavaFX](https://openjfx.io/) UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are present in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component does the following:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Todo` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/logic/Logic.java)

Below is a partial class diagram of the `Logic` component.

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `SoConnectParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to add a contact).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `SoConnectParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `SoConnectParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, etc.) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible, e.g., during testing.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omiited from the class diagram above) that are used for autocompleting a user's search command:

<img src="images/AutocompleteClasses.png"/>

How the autocompleting works:
* When called upon to autocomplete a user's search command, the `AutocompleteManager` classes uses the other classes shown above to autocomplete and create a list of autocomplete entries.
* The list of autocomplete entries will be passed to `CommandBox` for display.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png"/>


The `Model` component does the following:

* Stores the SoConnect data, i.e., all `Person` objects and all `Todo` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object and a `UniqueTodoList` object respectively).
* Stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Todo` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList` that can be 'observed' (e.g., the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change).
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `SoConnect`, which `Person` references. This allows `SoConnect` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects. <br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png"/>

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W15-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/soconnect/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png"/>

The `Storage` component does the following:
* Saves both SoConnect data and user preference data in `json` format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Inherits from `SoConnectStorage`, `TodoListStorage`, and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one of them (if only one of the functionality is needed).
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `soconnect.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sorting feature

#### Implementation

The sorting mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommand` and `SortCommandParser`.<br>
Additionally, the mechanism utilises the following operations in `UniquePersonList` to carry out sorting:

* `UniquePersonList#sortByName(Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the list of contacts by **Name** in alphabetical order.
* `UniquePersonList#sortByPhone(Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the list of contacts by **Phone** number in increasing order.
* `UniquePersonList#sortByEmail(Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the list of contacts by **Email** in alphabetical order.
* `UniquePersonList#sortByAddress(Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the list of contacts by **Address** in alphabetical order.
* `UniquePersonList#sortByTag(Tag tag, Boolean isReverse)`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the list of contacts by a specified **Tag**. Contacts containing it will be at the top of the list.

These operations sort in reverse order when `isReverse` is true.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface under the same method signature.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters `sort t/!friend n/` command to perform a multi-level sort. `SortCommandParser` calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenizeToList()` to separate the parameters of `t/!friend` and `n/`. The separated parameters are stored in a list that preserves the order that the user entered them in. `SortCommandParser` checks the list to confirm that at least 1 valid parameter has been entered.

Step 2. Each parameter is processed by `SortCommandParser#convertArguments`. They are checked for reversed sorting through the presence of `!`. The `friend` string is checked to see if it fulfils the requirements of the `Tag` class. If the user entered string values for non-`Tag` parameters (`n/NAME`, `p/PHONE`, `e/EMAIL`, `a/ADDRESS`), the string values are ignored and the command continues execution as per normal.

Step 3. The `sort` command sorts the currently displayed list by **Name** first, calling `Model#sortByName(Boolean isReverse)` where `isReverse = false`.

Step 4. The `sort` command reverse sorts the currently displayed list by the `friend` **Tag** next, calling `Model#sortByTag(Tag tag, Boolean isReverse)` where `isReverse = true`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SortCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 5. The user is shown the sorted list of contacts. The sorted list contains the same contacts as the previous displayed list. It has two sections, the first section contains contacts without the `friend` tag and the second section contains contacts with the `friend` tag. Each section is sorted by **Name** in alphabetical order.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to implement multi-level sorting:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sort the list once for each parameter entered by the user.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time needed to sort.

* **Alternative 2:** Single composite sorting method that combines all the individual sorting for each parameter.
    * Pros: Save time as only 1 sorting operation is carried out.
    * Cons: Harder to modify when more parameters are added. Can result in more bugs due to complexity.

### Search feature

#### Implementation

The search mechanism is facilitated by `SearchCommand` and `SearchCommandParser`.

This feature allows user to customise the contacts displayed based on the information provided. For example, user can decide to have specific search result that satisfies all the conditions or to have more generic result that only satisfies one of the conditions.

It implements the following main operations:

* `SearchCommand#execute(Model model)`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates _filtered_ person list to contain contacts that match the search query.
* `SearchCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses search query based on the condition and information specified.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the search mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `search n/John a/NUS` command to perform a joint search. `SearchCommandParser` calls `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenize` to group the search parameters according to the prefix `/n` and `/a`.

Step 2. The `search` command search the SoConnect by matching the search parameters and condition with the available contact information, calling `StringUtil#containsKeywordsIgnoreCase(String sentence, String keywords)`.

Step 3. The `search` command then updates _filtered_ person list to contains the matching contacts. If no matching contact is found,
 the `search` command will call `StringUtil#containsSomeKeywordsIgnoreCase(String sentence, String keywords)` to search for contacts that match partially to the search parameters.

The following sequence diagram shows how the search operation works:

![SearchSequenceDiagram](images/SearchSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `SearchCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 4. The user is shown the _filtered_ list. The _filtered_ list contains all contacts that are relevant to the user's search query.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to implement searching:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Search the list once for each parameter entered by the user.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of time needed to search.

* **Alternative 2:** Single complex searching method that combines all the individual searching for each parameter.
    * Pros: Save time as only 1 search operation is carried out.
    * Cons: Harder to modify when more parameters are added. Can result in more bugs due to complexity.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Autocomplete Feature

#### Implementation

The autocomplete mechanism is facilitated by `AutocompleteManager` and `CommandBox`. T`AutocompleteManager` contains a `UniquePersonList` which is used to filter and generate a list of autocomplete entries. The `CommandBox` calls methods from `AutocompleteManager` to get a list of autocomplete entries.

The main methods in `AutocompleteManager` are:
- `getAutocompleteEntries(String userInput)` - Gets a list of autocomplete entries.
- `getSearchCommandArguments(String userInput)` - Gets the arguments from the command if command is a search command,
otherwise an invalid argument.
- `getLastPrefixArguemnt(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes` - Gets the last prefix and argument from the
`argsString`.
- `updateFilteredPersonList(String argsString)` - Updates the `UniquePersonList` with filter.
- `generateAutocompleteEntries(String argsWithoutLastPrefixArguement, String lastPrefixArgument)` - Generates a list of
autocomplete entries by completing the sentence of the `lastPrefixArgument`.

The main methods in `CommandBox` are:
- `setAutocompleteListener()` - A listener that triggers `autocompleteAction` whenever user presses a key on the keyboard.
- `autocompleteAction()` - Gets a list of autocomplete entries from `AutocompleteManager` and displays it.
- `populatePopup(List<String> autocompleteEntries, String originalSearchInput)` - Fills up the autocomplete display box with the autocomplete entries.

This feature is an enhancement on the [**search feature**](#search-feature) (i.e. it only works when user is doing a searching). It only autocompletes the last prefix and argument of the user input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the autocomplete mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters `search n/John p/12345678 a/N` in the `CommandBox`. The `CommandBox#setAutocompleteListener()` calls `CommandBox#autocompleteAction()` as a key is pressed when the user types the command.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** At this step, the command is not executed yet as the user has not pressed the enter key.
</div>

Step 2. The `CommandBox#autocompleteAction()` calls `AutocompleteManager#getAutocompleteEntries(String userInput)` to get a list of autocomplete entries.

Step 3. The `AutocompleteManager#getSearchCommandArguments(String userInput)` will check if the command is a valid search command and return the valid search command arguments, otherwise an invalid argument and `AutocompleteManager`will return an empty list to `CommandBox`. Hence, for user input `search n/John a/N`, the valid search command arguments is `n/John p/12345678 a/N`.

Step 4. The search command arguments will be passed to `AutocompleteManager#getLastPrefixArgument(String argsString, Prefix... prefixes)` to get the last prefix and argument. If there is no valid last prefix and argument found, it will then return an invalid argument and similarly, `AutocompleteManager` returns an empty list to `CommandBox`. Given `n/John p/12345678 a/NUS`, the last prefix and argument is `a/N` where `a/` is the prefix and `N` is the argument.

Step 5. The `AutocompleteManager#updateFilteredPersonList(String argsString)` takes in the arguments without the last prefix and argument - `n/John p/12345678` and filters the `UniquePersonList` based on the condition and contact information available in ` n/John p/12345678`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** For `OR` condition, no filter will be applied to `UniquePersonList` (i.e. this returns every person in the list). This is because when the user wants to perform an `OR` condition search, the `Person` in `UniquePersonList` only has to satisfy one of the arguments given. Since we are autocompleting only the last prefix and argument, the `Person` in `UniquePersonList` will only need to satisfy the last prefix and argument.
</div>

Step 6. After the `UniquePersonList` is filtered, `AutocompleteManager#generateAutocompleteEntries(String argsWithoutLastPrefixArgument, String lastPrefixArgument)` will filter the filtered `UniquePersonList` with the last prefix and argument to generate a list of autocomplete entries.

For example, the filtered `UniquePersonList` has `Person1 - {n/John Loh, p/12345678, a/NUS}`, `Person2 - {n/John Teo, p/12345678, a/NTU}` and `Person3 - {n/John Wong, p/12345678, a/SMU}`. A filter and autocomplete will be done using the last prefix and argument - `a/N`, so this will filter out `Person3` as the person's address `a/SMU` does not match with `a/N`. After filtering, the prefix and argument will be autocompleted and the list of autocomplete entries will be return to `CommandBox`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The example, `Person1 - {n/John Loh, p/12345678, a/NUS}`, used above means the
`UniquePersonList` has a `Person` with information `n/John Loh`, `p/12345678` and `a/NUS`.
</div>

Step 7. The `CommandBox#autocompleteAction` will pass the list of autocomplete entries to `CommandBox#populatePopup(List<String> autocompleteEntries, String originalSearchInput)` to populate the autocomplete display box with the autocomplete entries and display to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user types a command in the `CommandBox`:

![AutocompleteActivityDiagram](images/AutocompleteActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the autocomplete operation works:

![AutocompleteSequenceDiagram](images/AutocompleteSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to generate autocomplete entries:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the streams feature in Java to filter the `UniquePersonList` and get the
autocomplete entries.
    * Pros: Easy to implement, many useful operations available.
    * Cons: Less efficient as more time to compare the strings.


* **Alternative 2:** Implement a trie data structure to store information and obtain the autocomplete entries from
the trie data structure.
    * Pros: More efficient way to searching a string.
    * Cons: More memory to store the strings. Have to refactor and modify the existing class and methods.

### Tag adding feature

#### Implementation

The tag adding mechanism is facilitated by `TagAddCommand` and `TagAddCommandParser`.
Additionally, The mechanism utilises the following operations in `UniqueTagList` and `UniquePersonList`.

* `UniqueTagList#hasTag(Tag tag)` - Checks if the tagList has the tag.
* `UniquePersonList#setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)` - Sets the same person with the new tag.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface under the same method name.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag adding mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `tag add 1 t/friend` command to add the tag, `friend`, to the contact indicated by the `INDEX`, 1.
`TagAddCommandParser` calls  `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenizeToList()` to separate the parameters of `1` and `t/friend`.

Step 2. The `tag add` command collects the list of contacts shown, containing them in `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`.

Step 3. The `tag add` command recreates the same contact and adds the new tag, containing this new contact in `TagAddCommand#createEditedPerson(Person personToEdit, Tag tag)`.

Step 4. The `tag add` command replaces the old contact with the new, updated contact, calling `Model#setPerson(Person target, Person editedPerson)`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a tag add command:

![TagAddSequenceDiagram](images/TagAddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `TagAddCommandParser` and `TagCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 5. The contact indicated by `INDEX` now has the `friend` tag.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to implement tag add:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new contact with the tag included.
    * Pros: Prevents direct access into the tags of a contact.
    * Cons: Potential error occurs if some form of duplication is allowed.

* **Alternative 2:** Directly add the tag into the contact .
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Easy to access into the tags of a contact. Could cause accidental bugs.

### Tag editing feature

The tag adding mechanism is facilitated by `TagEditCommand` and `TagEditCommandParser`.
Additionally, The mechanism utilises the following operations in `UniqueTagList`, `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueTodoList`.

* `UniqueTagList#editTag(Tag oldTag, Tag newTag)` - Changes the old tag with the new tag.
* `UniquePersonList#changeRelevantPersonTag(oldTag, newTag)` - Updates every person who has the old tag with the new tag.
* `UniqueTodoList#changeRelevantTodoTag(Tag oldTag, Tag newTag)` -  Updates every task which has the old tag with the new tag.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface under the same method name.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the tag editing mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `tag edit t/friend t/bestFriend` command to edit the old tag, `friend`, to the new tag, `bestFriend`.
`TageditCommandParser` calls  `ArgumentTokenizer#tokenizeToList()` to separate the parameters of `t/friend` and `t/bestFriend`.

Step 2. The `tag edit` command edits the old tag with the new tag, calling `Model#editTag(oldTag, newTag)`.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a tag add command:

![TagEditSequenceDiagram](images/TagEditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `TagEditCommandParser` and `TagCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 3. The old tag on every contact and every task is now replaced with the new tag for display.

#### Design consideration

**Aspect: How to implement tag edit:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new tag and replaces the old tag with the new one.
    * Pros: Prevents direct access into the information of a tag.
    * Cons: Tedious. Necessary to manually change the old tag in every contact and every task.

* **Alternative 2:** Change the tag's name.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Can potentially introduce bugs due to direct access into the tag's implementation.

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_

### Customise Order Feature

#### Implementation

This feature is mainly implemented by the `CustomiseOrderCommand` and `PersonCard` classes. The following methods are the main ones:

* `CustomiseOrderCommand#execute()` - saves the new attribute order in the `preferences.json` file by calling `Model#setGuiSettings()`.
* `PersonCard#setAttributes()` - reads the order from the `preferences.json` file and builds the `PersonCard` in the order specified.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how this feature behaves at each part of the mechanism.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The user sees a list of contacts, each contact contains a name, a phone number, an email, an address and possibly some tags. Under each contacts' name, the current order the user sees is: `TAGS`, `PHONE`, `EMAIL` and `ADDRESS` (this is also the default order).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The name will always be at the top of each contact as it is the most crucial information of each contact.

</div>

Step 2. The user executes `customise order e/` as the user wants the emails appear right below the name.

Step 3. `SoConnectParaser` processes the input and calls the parser `CustomiseCommandParser` to parse `" order e/"`.

Step 4. `CustomiseCommandParser` processes the input and calls the parser `CustomiseOrderCommandParser` to parse `" e/"`.

Step 5. `CustomiseOrderCommandParser` processes the input into a list of attributes. In this case, the list of attributes only contains `EMAIL` and is missing the attributes `TAGS`, `PHONE` and `ADDRESS`. The missing attributes are added to the list according to the default order mentioned above. The list of attributes now contains `EMAIL`, `TAGS`, `PHONE` and `ADDRESS`.

Step 6. `CustomiseOrderCommandParser` creates a `CustomiseOrderCommand` with the list of attributes.

Step 7. `CustomiseOrderCommandParser` returns the `CustomiseOrderCommand`.

Step 8. `Logic` executes the `CustomiseOrderCommand`.

Step 9. `CustomiseOrderCommand#execute()` calls `Model#setGuiSettings()` to save the new attribute order in `preferences.json`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates Steps 3 to 9:

![CustomiseOrderSequenceDiagram](images/CustomiseOrderSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `CustomiseOrderCommandParser` and `CustomiseCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

Step 10. The user sees the new ordering after `PersonCard#setAttributes()` sets the attributes based of the new order in `preferences.json`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the user closes the application and relaunches the application, the attributes are still in the same order that the user set previously.

</div>

#### Design consideration
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Sets the order by using 4 placeholder JavaFX `FlowPane`.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Hard to maintain if different styling required for different attributes.

* **Alternative 2:** Have 24 different FXML files and use the one that is in the required order.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Harder to maintain and make changes.

## **Appendix: Effort**

### Morphing of AB3
Achievements:
1. Refactored all the packages to suit SoConnect identity.
2. Added new logic class called `Autocomplete` that can automatically make search suggestion for user.
3. Added new commands for Contact Management, Todo Management, Tag Management and Customisation.
4. For Contact Management, we implemented new command `sort` to allow for sorting contacts and replaced the limited `find` command with more advanced `search` command that was inspired by how Google works.
5. For Todo Management, we put in almost the same effort required to implement Contact Management from scratch, as Todo Management offers almost the same range of functionalities as Contact Management.
6. For Tag Management, we implemented new classes that mirror the functionalities of Contact and Todo Management, as it is also capable of adding, editing, deleting tags.
7. For Customisation, we implemented dynamic styling that allows user to modify how the information fields are shown.

Challenges:
1. As we were adding a lot of functionalities and made modifications to existing AB3 features, we had to spend a lot of time to make sure everything was well integrated and connected.
2. We had to put a lot of consideration into the commands design, as our product is dealing with not just contacts, but also todos.

### Revamping of UI
Achievement:
We transformed the AB3 traditional interface to a sophisticated, modern-looking UI that is more user-friendly and pleasing to use.

Challenges:
1. None of us was familiar with JavaFX. Therefore, we needed to put a large amount of time into mastering JavaFX from scratch as well as understanding the structure of AB3.
2. We had to restructure a lot of .fxml and .css files to allow for easier readability as well as incorporating the UI design into our features.
3. Since we made many additions, such as Todo Management, Tag Management and Customisation, we had to put a lot of effort into producing a well-integrated and working UI that allows all these features to run smoothly.
