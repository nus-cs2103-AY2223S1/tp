## **Introduction**
Welcome to the Developer Guide for **Tuthub**, a Command Line Interface (CLI) App that will help you find your next batch of teaching assistants (TA) in no time! Tuthub is a desktop app for NUS professors who wish to track and choose their next batch of teaching assistants/tutors based on their past performance and records but have little time to spare for tedious administrative work.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuthub/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuthub/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuthub/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="90%" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `TutorListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuthub/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Tutor` object residing in the `Model`.

In addition to the third point above, the `CommmandExecutor` functional interface, initially encapsulated inside the `CommandBox` class, was abstracted out to allow multiple `UI` components to communicate with the `Logic` component. `MainWindow` creates a `CommandExecutor`, which is then passed down to `CommandBox` and `TutorListCard` to communicate with `Logic` in order to execute a command.

<img src="images/CommandExecutorClassDiagram.png" width="280" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuthub/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TuthubParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a tutor).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TuthubParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TuthubParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuthub/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

* stores tuthub data i.e., all `Tutor` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTutorList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Tutor` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Tutor>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `Tuthub`, which `Tutor` references. This allows `Tuthub` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Tutor` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/tuthub/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both tuthub data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TuthubStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `tuthub.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Feature

Tutor information is stored as `Tutor` objects, which captures all the information that the tutor represents. When the user adds a tutor, the program creates a new `Tutor` object with the given information and adds it to the `ObservableList` to be displayed in the program. The `Model` class handles the checking of uniqueness while the `Storage` class handles the conversion of the `Tutor` object to a [JSON](https://www.json.org/) format and updating of the storage file in `{source_root}/data/Tuthub.json`.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The following methods in `Tuthub` manage the addition of tutors:
* `Tuthub#AddCommand(Tutor tutor)` - Adds the provided tutor to the list of tutors created
* `Tuthub#AddCommandParser(String args)` - Parses the `add` command and determines the attributes of the `Tutor` object created based on the given prefixes

Given below are the different steps taken when the user adds tutors.

Step 1: The user enters the command word `add`, followed by the prefixes and information that they want to store. Example: `add n/John Doe p/98765432 e/e0782693 m/CS2100 y/3 s/A0123496X tn/1 r/5.0 t/senior`.

Step 2: The program makes use of `TuthubParser` to make sense of the keyword and determine which parser to use to parse the arguments. In this case, the `AddCommandParser` is used.

Step 3: The `AddCommandParser` makes sense of the arguments through the use of the prefixes, with the help of `ParserUtil`, and creates an `AddCommand` object with the provided information in the form of a `Tutor` object.

Step 4: The `AddCommand` object is executed. The `Tutor` object created in step 3 is added to the list of tutors captured in the `ModelManager` class, which then utilises the `UI` class to display the created `Tutor` object.

Step 5: The execution ends and returns a `CommandResult` object contained the success message to be displayed to the GUI to the user.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations:

![AddSequenceDiagram](./images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Extra information on how `ModelManager` handles adding of tutors:

The `ModelManager` class calls on the `addTutor` method of `Tuthub`, which calls on the `add` method of the `UniqueTutorList` currently present in Tuthub. `UniqueTutorList` enforces the checking of uniqueness before the tutor is added and displayed in the `observableList`.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations:

![AddSequenceModelDiagram](./images/AddSequenceModelDiagram.png)

<ins>Design considerations</ins>:

**Aspect: Implementation of `add`**
- **Alternative 1:** Add the tutor to a list that is maintained by the `Model` class **(chosen)**
  - Pros: Tutor can be viewed in the GUI once added without requiring any additional reading from storage.
  - Cons: More complex implementation of `add` needed due to requirement for both adding to model and storage.
- **Alternative 2:** Add the tutor directly to the `Storage` class as a JSON object
  - Pros: Less memory needed to store an extra list, especially when there would be a large number of tutors
  - Cons: The `Storage` class would be handling both storing of the Tuthub file and providing of the list to the UI, which would violate OOP principles.

### Find Feature

This feature filters TutHub's filtered list of tutors based on a predicate on whether a tutor's attribute contains the keywords
being searched. User are to specify which attribute of the tutor to search for by including the prefix of the attribute when using the command.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The `find` command involves the logic, model and UI components of Tuthub.
Tutor information is stored in a `Tutor` object, where each piece of information is an object on its own.
E.g. `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`. When the user wants to find a tutor, the user specifies the `Prefix` corresponding
to the specific attribute of the tutor followed by the keywords to be searched. `Tutor` objects that are matched the
keywords being searched are added to the `FilteredList` to be displayed in the program to the user.

The following methods in `Tuthub` manage the finding of tutors:
* `Tuthub#FindByNameCommand(NameContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with names matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `Tuthub#FindByPhoneCommand(PhoneContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with phone number matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `Tuthub#FindByEmailCommand(EmailContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with emails matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `Tuthub#FindByModuleCommand(ModuleContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with modules matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `Tuthub#FindByYearCommand(YearContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with year matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `Tuthub#FindByStudentIdCommand(StudenIdContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with student ids matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `Tuthub#FindByTeachingNominationCommand(TeachingNominationContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with teaching nominations matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `Tuthub#FindByRatingCommand(RatingContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with rating matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `Tuthub#FindByTagCommand(TagContainsKeywordsPredicate predicate)` - Finds and adds tutors with tags matching keywords to list of tutors displayed
* `Tuthub#FindByPrefixParser(String args)` - Parses the `find` command and determines the `prefix` corresponding to the attribute to search through to find matching tutors
* `ModelManager#filteredTutors` - A `javafx.collections.transformation.FilteredList` that contains a list of filtered tutors according to a predicate
* `ModelManager#getSortedFilteredTutorList()` - Returns the `sortedFilteredTutors` list
* `ModelManager#updateFilteredTutorList(Predicate<Tutor> predicate)` - Updates filtered list based on predicate

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user is finding tutors whose names contain "alex".

Step 1: The user enter the command `find n/alex`.

Step 2: TutHub uses `TuthubParser` to determine which parser to use based on the command input by the user. In this case, `FindByPrefixParser` is used to parse the `find` command.

Step 3: `FindByPrefixCommandParser` parses the `find` command to determine the attribute to search through and the keywords input by the user.
`FindByPrefixCommandParser` creates a `FindByNameCommand` that extends `FindByPrefixCommand` with the keywords put into a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object.

Step 4: The `FindByNameCommand` is executed and tutors with names containing the string "alex" are added to the filtered list of tutors that have names
containing the string alex captured in the `ModelManager` object, which makes use of the `UI` class to display the matching tutors.

Step 5: The execution ends, returning a `CommandResult` object that has the success message to be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding the parsing details):
![FindSequenceDiagram](./images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

**Aspect: Implementation of `find`**
- **Alternative 1:** `find` command integrates the use of prefixes in user input to determine which tutor attribute to search through. (i.e. `find n/alex`, `find s/A0123456X`) **(chosen)**.
    - Pros: Better OOP practice as the resultant find commands are all subclasses of `FindByPrefixCommand`
    - Cons: Took more time to think of and implement.
- **Alternative 2:** Individual attributes of the tutor have their own find command (E.g. `findByName`, `findByEmail`)
    - Pros: Easier to implement individual commands for each attribute.
    - Cons: Poor OOP practice the individual commands are all `find` commands and should not be a different class on its own. User also have more commands to remember.

### View Feature

The `view` command involves operations within the `UI` and communication with `Logic` and `Model` to display/hide the tutor details panel. 

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The communication between the logic and UI classes is facilitated by the `CommandResult` class, where the following field has been added:
- `CommandResult#isView` - Indicates if the current command is a `view` command.

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user enters a `view` command in the command box and how the view mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user enters the command `view 1`.

Step 2: The `TuthubParser` verifies the `ViewCommand#COMMAND_WORD`, and requests `ViewCommandParser` to parse. The `ViewCommandParser` verifies the appropriateness of the user input (`index`).

Step 3: Upon parsing, a new `ViewCommand` is created based on the valid index.

Step 4: When the `ViewCommand` is executed, a new `CommandResult` of type `isView` is created and `ModelManager#tutorToView` is updated with the selected tutor. The following sequence diagram demonstrates the main operations carried out between `Logic` and `Model` (with `UI` details omitted):

<img src="images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png"/>

Step 5: Upon recognising the `CommandResult` is of `isView` type, `MainWindow` calls `logic#getTutorToView()` to get the tutor to be displayed from `Model`, which is then passed into `MainWindow#handleView(Tutor tutor)`.

Step 6: This causes the `TutorDetailsPanel` of the `tutor` to be set as visible, resulting in the side panel being displayed. The following sequence diagram demonstrates the detailed operations carried out between `UI`, `Logic` and `Model`:

<img src="images/ViewSequenceUiDiagram.png" width="90%"/>

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

**Aspect: Method to pass a `Tutor` to UI**
- **Alternative 1:** Store the tutor to be viewed as a field in `Model` **(chosen)**.
  - Pros: Better OOP practice since `Model` handles all the data related to tutors.
  - Cons: Harder to implement as more supporting methods are required to communicate between `UI` and `Model`.

- **Alternative 2:** Store the tutor in `CommandResult`.
  - Pros: Easier to implement and fewer methods may be needed in `Logic` and `Model` as the tutor can be passed to
  the `MainWindow` directly through `CommandResult`.
  - Cons: Poor OOP practice as it does not make sense for `CommandResult` to store a `Tutor`, and other commands do not
  require a `Tutor` object to be stored.

### Edit Feature

This command allows users to edit a specific tutor (by `INDEX`) in `Tuthub`'s displayed list.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

Similar to [`add` command](#add-feature), the `edit` command involves the logic and model components of Tuthub, where the `Model` class handles the checking of uniqueness.

The following methods in particular facilitate the editing of tutors:
* `EditCommand#createEditedTutor(Tutor tutor, EditTutorDescriptor descriptor)` - Creates a new `Tutor` object with updated fields to replace the existing one.
* `Model#setTutor(Tutor target, Tutor editedTutor)` - Replaces the current `target` tutor with the new `editedTutor`

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user edits a tutor.

Step 1: The user enters the command word `edit`, followed by an index and the prefixes and corresponding descriptions that they want to change. Example: `edit 1 n/John Doe`.

Step 2: The `TuthubParser` verifies the `EditCommand#COMMAND_WORD`, and requests `EditCommandParser` to parse.

Step 3: The `EditCommandParser` makes sense of the arguments through the use of the prefixes, with the help of `ParserUtil`, and creates an `EditCommand` object with the target index and the provided information stored in an `editTutorDescriptor` object.

Step 4: When the `EditCommand` is executed, `EditCommand#createEditedTutor(Tutor tutor, EditTutorDescriptor descriptor)` creates a new `Tutor` object with the updated field.

Step 5: The new `Tutor` is then passed into `Model#setTutor(Tutor target, Tutor editedTutor)`, which replaces the original `target` tutor with the `editedTutor` in the `UniqueTutorList` in Tuthub after checking for duplicates.

Step 5: The execution ends and returns a `CommandResult` object contained the success message to be displayed to the GUI to the user.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding details of how the current tutor was obtained from `Model`):

<img src="images/EditSequenceDiagram.png"/>

### Sort Feature

This command sorts `Tuthub`'s displayed list based on quantitative measures, such as teaching nominations and ratings. Users are allowed to choose to sort in ascending or descending order.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The `sort` command involves the logic, model, and UI part of Tuthub. Most updates are made within the `ModelManager`, which are:
- `ModelManager#sortedFilteredTutors` - A `javafx.collections.transformation.SortedList` that contains `ModelManager#filteredTutors`.
- `ModelManager#getSortedFilteredTutorList()` - Now returns the `sortedFilteredTutors` list.
- `ModelManager#updateSortedTutorList(Comparator<Tutor>)` - Similar to `ModelManager#updateFilteredTutorList`, but updates the Comparator instead of predicate.

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user enters a `sort` command in the command box and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user enters the command `sort a r/`.

Step 2: The `TuthubParser` verifies the `SortCommand#COMMAND_WORD`, and requests `SortCommandParser` to parse. The `SortCommandParser` verifies the appropriateness of the user input (`order` and `prefix`) and creates the proper `Comparator` based on the user request.

Step 3: Upon parsing, a new `SortCommand` is created based on the order, prefix, and comparator.

Step 4: In the `SortCommand` execution, the `model#updateSortedTutorList(Comparator<Tutor>)` is called upon with the proper `Comparator`. Then, a new `CommandResult` is created and stored in `LogicManager`.

Step 5: Upon recognising the `CommandResult`, `MainWindow` calls `logic#getFilteredTutorList()` to get the tutor cards to be displayed, which is passed as a constructor variable into `TutorListPanel`.

Step 6: Then, the `TutorListPanel` sets the items to view as the new and updated `sortedFilteredTutors` list.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations:

![SortSequenceDiagram](./images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

**Aspect: The scope of `sort` (should it be able to sort filtered tutors or not?)**
- **Alternative 1:** Able to sort any `FilteredList` (i.e. the original tutor list or a tutor list after executing a `find` command) **(chosen)**.
    - Pros: The `sort` feature achieves its primary purpose while also having a defensive implementation, as it does not directly access and affect `Tuthub#UniqueTutorList`
    - Cons: Took more time to think of and implement.

- **Alternative 2:** `sort` redefines the original `Tuthub#UniqueTutorList`.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: Feature becomes limited and lacking of purpose. Direct changes to original `Tuthub#UniqueTutorList` is less defensive.

**Aspect: Keeping track of sorting and filtering of the tutor list**
- **Alternative 1:** Store the `FilteredList` in the `SortedList` **(chosen)**.
    - Pros: Better OOP practice since the `FilteredList` and `SortedList` variables can be kept `final`.
    - Cons: Implementation is easy, but may be confusing to understand why and how it works.

- **Alternative 2:** Store two lists, one for `FilteredList` and one for `SortedList`.
    - Pros: Idea is more simply understood. Serves the main purpose of `sort` if implemented correctly.
    - Cons: Complicated to implement and possibility of many bugs. Poor OOP practice as it may require reassigning of the `FilteredList` and `SortedList` variables.

### Mail Feature

This command allows users to easily contact tutors from `Tuthub`'s displayed list. Users can mail a specific tutor (by `INDEX`) or **all** the currently displayed tutors.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The `mail` command involves the logic and model part of Tuthub. Other than that, it relies on the `Java` classes, [`java.awt.Desktop`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Desktop.html) and [`java.net.URI`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URI.html).

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user enters a `mail` command in the command box.

Step 1: The user enters the command `mail all`.

Step 2: The `TuthubParser` verifies the `MailCommand#COMMAND_WORD`, and requests `MailCommandParser` to parse. The `MailCommandParser` verifies the appropriateness of the user input (in this case, the valid inputs are `INDEX` or "`all`").

Step 3: Upon parsing, a new `MailCommand` is created based on the target, which is `all`.

Step 4: In the `MailCommand` execution, the `URI` message is created by getting the emails (`Tutor#getEmail()`) of each tutor in the currently displayed list. The emails are combined in the `message` variable, which is then used as an argument in `URI#create(String)`. 

Step 5: The user's default mail client is accessed by calling `Desktop#mail(URI)` with the recently created `uri` as the argument. Then, a new `CommandResult` is created and stored in `LogicManager`.

Step 6: Upon recognising the `CommandResult`, `MainWindow` displays the resulting `CommandResult`.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding [`java.awt.Desktop`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/Desktop.html), [`java.net.URI`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/net/URI.html), and obtaining `Tutor` email data):

![MailSequenceDiagram](./images/MailSequenceDiagram.png)

### Comment Feature

This command adds a comment to a tutor in `Tuthub`'s displayed list.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The `comment` command involves the logic and model part of Tuthub.
This involves the updating of the `CommentList` of the tutor via:
- `CommentList#addComment(Comment comment)` - Adds the `Comment` to the `CommentList`

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user enters a `comment` command in the command box and how the comment is added to the tutor.

Step 1: The user enters the command `comment 1 c/Often late`.

Step 2: The `TuthubParser` verifies the `CommentCommand#COMMAND_WORD`, and requests `CommentCommandParser` to parse.
The `CommentCommandParser` verifies the appropriateness of the user input (`index` and `comment`).

Step 3: Upon parsing, a new `CommentCommand` is created based on the `index` and the `comment`.
A new `Comment` is created based on the `comment` parsed. 

Step 4: In the `CommentCommand` execution, the `ModelManager#getSortedFilteredTutorList()` is called upon to retrieve the list of displayed tutors.
The `Tutor` whose index matches the `index` is then stored (after accounting for 0 based indexing).
In this case, the first `Tutor` is selected.

Step 5: For this `Tutor`, the `tutor#getComments` is called upon to retrieve the `CommentList` of the `Tutor`.

Step 6: The `Comment` stored in the `CommentCommand` is then added to the `CommentList` through `CommentList#addComment`.

![CommentSequenceDiagram](./images/CommentSequenceDiagram.png)

<ins>Design Considerations</ins>

**Aspect: How are the comments stored?**
- **Alternative 1:** Store the comments as a list of comments, appending the comments to the list as needed. **(chosen)**
    - Pros: It is easier to add a `comment` and remove them from each tutor.
    - Cons: Took more time to think of and implement.

- **Alternative 2:** Store the `comment` as a string, replacing it everytime a new comment is added to the tutor.
    - Pros: Easier to implement.
    - Cons: It is harder to add and remove comments from each tutor, as the previous comments need to be copied and then added manually by the user.

### Delete Comment Feature

This command deletes a comment from a tutor in `Tuthub`'s displayed list.

<ins>Implementation</ins>

The `deletecomment` command involves the logic and model part of Tuthub.
This involves the updating of the `CommentList` of the tutor via:
- `CommentList#deleteComment(int index)` - Deletes the `Comment` at the `index` of the `CommentList`

Given below is an example usage scenario when the user enters a `deletecomment` command in the command box and how the comment is removed from the tutor.

Step 1: The user enters the command `deletecomment 1 1`.

Step 2: The `TuthubParser` verifies the `DeleteCommentCommand#COMMAND_WORD`, and requests `DeleteCommentCommandParser` to parse.
The `DeleteCommentCommandParser` verifies the appropriateness of the user input (`tutorIndex` and `commentIndex`).

Step 3: Upon parsing, a new `DeleteCommentCommand` is created based on the `tutorIndex` and the `commentIndex`.
Both indexes are converted to 0 based indexing.
In this case, the `tutorIndex` and `commentIndex` are both set to `0`.

Step 4: In the `DeleteCommentCommand` execution, the `ModelManager#getSortedFilteredTutorList()` is called upon to retrieve the list of displayed tutors.
The `Tutor` whose index matches the `tutorIndex` is then stored. 
In this case, the first `Tutor` is selected.

Step 5: For this `Tutor`, the `tutor#getComments` is called upon to retrieve the `CommentList` of the `Tutor`. 

Step 6: The `CommentList` retrieves the `Comment` that is at the index specified by `commentIndex`.
This `Comment` is then deleted from the `CommentList`.
In this case, the first `Comment` of the first `Tutor` is deleted.

The following sequence diagram demonstrates the above operations (excluding the parsing details):

## **Appendix A: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

Our target users are **National University of Singapore (NUS) Professors** who:
* have to manage a significant number (up to hundreds) of teaching assistant (TA) profiles
* seek a more organised and systematic way of managing profiles as compared to Excel sheets
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* are reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

TutHub helps professors find TAs efficiently by consolidating information in an easy-to-read, easy-to-search manner by providing a systematic and visual way to categorise or sort profiles according to modules, year, performance, etc.
