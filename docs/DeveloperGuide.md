### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

#### 3.1.1 Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


#### 3.1.2 How the architecture components interact with each other

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command [`delClient i/1`](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w16-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html#714-delete-client-delclient) (deletes the client found at index 1).

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### 3.2 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ClientListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Updates the currently displayed panel to one of the five different types (clients list, meetings list, products list, detailed client view, detailed meeting view) based on the result of the last command executed.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Client`, `Meeting`, and `Product` objects residing in the `Model`.

### 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `MyInsuRecParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddClientCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a client).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("addClient n/John Tan p/12345678")` API call.
<!-- @@author rexong -->

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteClientCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `MyInsuRecParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddClientCommand`) which the `MyInsuRecParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddClientCommandParser`, `DeleteClientCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### 3.4 Model component

#### 3.4.1 Overall structure
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the _MyInsuRec_ data i.e., all `Client` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueClientList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Client` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Client>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
* `Client`, `Meeting` and `Product` have attributes here that are abstracted and portrayed in the following subsections. Not all dependencies and composition will be shown.

#### 3.4.2 Client

<img src="images/ClientClassDiagram.png" width="590" />

#### 3.4.3 Meeting

<img src="images/MeetingClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

#### 3.4.4 Product

<img src="images/ProductClassDiagram.png" width="160" />

### 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="570" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both _MyInsuRec_ data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `MyInsuRecStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

## 4. Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 4.1 `Client`-related features

#### 4.1.1 Add client with product

Syntax: `addClient n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [b/BIRTHDAY] [pd/PRODUCT]...`

Purpose: Adds a client with the given information to the internal model and storage

Here, we are interested in the use of adding a client and associating it with a product.

##### Implementation

Below is an activity diagram that illustrates how a user might use the addClient feature and associate the added client with a product.

![AddClientWithProductActivityDiagram](images/AddClientWithProductActivityDiagram.png)

##### Design Considerations

We decided to only allow adding of a client with its product only after the product is already added using `addProduct`.

This is to try and maintain the overall cleanliness and housekeeping of _MyInsuRec_. Suppose we allow the user to add the client with any product name without it already existing in the product list. This might be organized and clean for the first few contacts added, but over time, the product name can get distorted. Shorthand forms may be used in place of the product name, case sensitivity and whitespaces are ignored. With _MyInsuRec_ also placing a focus on allowing users to get an idea of the popularity of each of the products they are selling, it is paramount that the product name stay the same, so as to enable the feature to work. Furthermore, one of the problems we are attempting to solve is the messiness of using traditional Excel spreadsheets. Having this validation check helps to preserve the data added, and thus the user can use the app for a longer time without feeling cluttered.

#### 4.1.2 Birthday constraints

Below is the activity diagram that illustrates the process of validating birthday when birthday of a client is added.

![BirthdayActivityDiagram](images/BirthdayActivityDiagram.png)

We decided to set these 2 constraints on birthday:

1) Birthday should not be in the future.

2) Birthday should not be more than 100 years ago as we feel that client would not be able to buy product due to age limit.
<!-- @@author thomashoooo -->
#### 4.1.3 View client

Syntax: `viewClient i/INDEX`, where `INDEX` is an index shown in the client list.

Purpose: View details associated to the client, such as the client's birthday and address, as well as the meeting details with the client.

##### Implementation

Usage Scenario of `viewClient`:

1) User inputs `viewClient i/1` to view the first client in the `Model`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If `INDEX` is larger than the current client list's size or `INDEX` is negative, then it will not show any client details. It will return an error to the user.

</div>

<!-- @@author rexong -->
#### 4.1.4 Delete Client

Syntax: `delClient i/INDEX`, where `INDEX` is an index shown in the client list.

Purpose: Delete client from model and storage.

##### Implementation

Usage Scenario of `delClient`:

1) User inputs `listClient` to view the current list of clients in `Model` with their respective indexes.

2) User inputs `delClient i/1` to delete the first client in the shown in `listClient`. This will evoke the `Command#execute` in `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions between the `Logic` and `Model` after the execution of `delClient i/1`.

#### 4.1.5 Edit Client feature

Syntax: `editClient i/INDEX [n/NAME] [p/PHONE_NUMBER] [a/ADDRESS] [e/EMAIL] [b/BIRTHDAY] [pd/PRODUCT]`

Purpose: Edit a `Client` from the `UniqueClientList` in `Model`.

##### Implementation

Usage Scenario of `editClient`:

1) User inputs `editClient i/1 a/123 Street` to edit the first client in the `Model` by adding an address.

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates the execution of `editClient i/1 a/123 Street` command and the interaction with `Model`.

![EditClientSequenceDiagram](images/EditClientSequenceDiagram.png)

### 4.2 `Meeting`-related features

#### 4.2.1 Add meeting

Syntax: `addMeeting i/INDEX d/DATE st/START_TIME et/END_TIME dn/DESCRIPTION`

Purpose: Adds a meeting with the given information to the internal model and storage

##### Implementation

In keeping with the command execution structure of the overall program, the command specific classes `AddMeetingCommand` and `AddMeetingCommandParser` were added to the commands and parser packages respectively. The main parser `MyInsuRecParser` was also modified to accept the new command word, `addMeeting`.

Usage scenario of `addMeeting`:

1) User inputs `addMeeting i/1 st/1000 et/1100 d/12122022 dn/Meeting with Alex` to add a meeting with the first client in the list.

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates the execution of `addMeeting i/1 st/1000 et/1100 d/12122022 dn/Meeting with Alex` command and the interaction with `Model`.

![AddMeetingSequenceDiagram](images/AddMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Considerations

**Aspect: What the addMeeting command accepts as a reference to a client:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accept the client's list index.
    - Pros: Each valid index is guaranteed to refer to a unique client.
    - Cons: It is less intuitive for the user compared to typing in a name.
- **Alternative 2:** Accept the client's name.
    - Pros: It is intuitive for the user to enter a name.
    - Cons: Names have to be spelt exactly as stored, otherwise the name.
      could be referencing more than one client.

**Aspect: The parameters that the AddMeetingCommand constructor should accept:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Accept the parsed command arguments separately.
    - Pros: The logic and operations on the model that are associated with
      command execution are inside the AddMeetingCommand.
    - Cons: The design of AddMeetingCommand is less intuitive.
- **Alternative 2:** Accept a completed Meeting.
    - Pros: The design of AddMeetingCommand is simpler.
    - Cons: The parser will need to have access to the model in order to
      obtain the referenced client.

#### 4.2.2 Meeting date constraints

Below is the activity diagram that illustrates the process of validating meeting date.

![MeetingDateActivityDiagram](images/MeetingDateActivityDiagram.png)

We decided to set this constraint on meeting date:

1) Meeting Date is not in the past.

<!-- @@author rexong -->
#### 4.2.3 Delete meeting

Syntax: `delMeeting i/INDEX`, where `INDEX` is an index shown in the meeting list.

Purpose: Delete a specified `Meeting` from the Meeting List in `Model`

##### Implementation

Usage Scenario of `delMeeting`:

1) User inputs `listMeeting` to view the current meetings in the `Model`'s Meeting List with their respective indexes.

2) User then inputs `delMeeting i/1` to delete the first meeting shown in `listMeeting`. This will evoke `Command#execute` in `LogicManager`.

_The sequence diagram and activity diagram of `delMeeting` is similar to the diagrams shown in [`delClient`](#414-delete-client) feature by replacing all occurrence of `client` with `meeting`._

##### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How many meetings to delete in one command**

- **Alternative Solution 1 (Current Choice):** Allows only one deletion
    - Pros: Easy to implement
    - Cons: Troublesome in the event where multiple meetings
- **Alternative Solution 2:** Allows multiple deletion
    - Pros: Convenient to delete multiple meetings when needed.
    - Cons: Complex to implement
- Considering that the approach taken to develop _MyInsuRec_ is a breath first approach, where we should only build to the point where every iteration is a working product, **Solution 1** is thus chosen as it is easier to implement. However, Solution 2 could be a possible implementation for future iteration.

#### 4.2.4 View meeting

Syntax: `viewMeeting i/INDEX`, where `INDEX` is an index shown in the meeting list.

Purpose: View details associated with a meeting, such as meeting’s date and time.

##### Implementation

Usage Scenario of `viewMeeting`:

1) User inputs `viewMeeting i/1` to view the first meeting in the `Model`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If `INDEX` is larger than the current meeting list's size or `INDEX` is negative, then it will not show any meeting details. It will return an error to the user.
</div>

_The sequence diagram and activity diagram of `viewMeeting` is similar to the diagrams shown in [`viewClient`](#413-view-client) feature by replacing all occurrence of `client` with `meeting`._
<!-- @@author -->
#### 4.2.5 List meeting

Syntax: `listMeeting [d/PERIOD]`

Purpose: View all `Meeting` from the Meeting List in `Model`, optionally using `d/PERIOD` to filter out `Meeting` from a specific time period.

##### Implementation

Usage Scenario of `listMeeting`:

1) User inputs `listMeeting d/tomorrow` to view the meetings for tomorrow in the `Model`.

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates the execution of `listMeeting d/tomorrow` command and the interaction with `Model`.

![ListMeetingSequenceDiagram](images/ListMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Considerations

**Aspect: What the `listMeeting` command accepts for the `PERIOD` prefix:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use the same prefix as `DATE` (that is, `d/`)
    - Pros: Users will have to remember lesser prefixes for specifying inputs for a similar domain of dates.
    - Cons: It might be slightly confusing what values can be used for a specific prefix.
- **Alternative 2:** Use another prefix e.g., `prd/`
    - Pros: It might be more intuitive for a new user.
    - Cons: There is limited number of short, representative prefixes that can be used and we feel that we are using quite a number of prefixes already. For example, we want to use `pd/` as a shorthand for `PERIOD`, but that is taken up by `PRODUCT` already. We want to use `p/`, but that is also taken up by `PHONE`. So we feel that it is best to use a keyword in a similar domain.

#### 4.2.6 Edit Meeting feature

Syntax: `editMeeting i/INDEX [d/DATE] [st/START TIME] [et/END TIME] [dn/DESCRIPTION]`

Purpose: Edit a `Meeting` from the `NoConflictMeetingList` in `Model`

##### Implementation

Usage Scenario of `editMeeting`:

1) User inputs `editMeeting i/1 d/09112023` to edit the first meeting in the `Model` by changing its date.

Every `Meeting` is uniquely identified by a UUID in storage, so essentially all fields in a `Meeting` can be edited without loss of its uniqueness.
Below is an activity diagram that summarizes how the updates are reflected in _MyInsuRec_.
`EditMeetingCommand#execute` caused the model to be updated first and then the storage.

<img src="images/EditActivityDiagram.png" width="200" />

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates the execution of `editMeeting i/1 d/09112023` command and the interaction with `Model`.

![EditMeetingSequenceDiagram](images/EditMeetingSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Class that triggers `Model` and `Storage` update**

- **Alternative Solution 1 (current choice):** `LogicManager#execute` causes both updates
    - Pros: Any error in updating storage or model can be identified within `execute()`.
    - Cons: Execute command performs two functions, update model and update storage, which is not ideal for separating responsibilities.
- **Alternative Solution 2:** `LogicManager` causes `Model` update which internally triggers `Storage` update
    - Pros: Removes one instance of cohesion between `Logic` and `Storage` (`Logic` can access `Storage` via `Model` only).
    - Cons: `Model` is a single point of failure in this scheme.
- `LogicManager` is responsible for coordinating both `Model` and `Storage` updates because `Model` and `Storage` should be kept as separate entities according to the architecture. **Solution 1** is thus chosen as it maintains the design pattern chosen in the architecture.

<img src="images/AlternativeEditActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### 4.3 `Product`-related features
<!-- @@author thomashoooo -->
#### 4.3.1 Add product

Syntax: `addProduct pd/PRODUCT_NAME`

Purpose: Add a self-defined product with a name `PRODUCT_NAME` into the product list to keep track of the products that the financial advisor sells.

##### Implementation

Usage Scenario of `addProduct`:

1) User inputs `addProduct pd/PrudenSure` to add PrudenSure in the product list.

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates the execution of `addProduct` command.

<!-- @@author -->
### 4.4 UI

#### 4.4.1 Different view panels

View panels are one of the main component of the UI and the main component where a user sees the results of their commands. Examples of view panel include `MeetingListPanel`, `ClientDetailedViewPanel` and more.

The GUI changes view panels depending on the last executed command. For example, a `listMeeting` will cause the meeting list view panel to be displayed, while `viewClient i/1` will cause a detailed client view panel to be displayed.

##### Implementation

Below is a sequence diagram that illustrates the execution of `listMeeting` command and the interaction with `Model`, which demonstrates how a view panel changes to `MeetingListPanel`.

![DifferentViewPanelsSequenceDiagram](images/DifferentViewPanelsSequenceDiagram.png)

##### Rationale

We chose to implement the changing of view panels through `CommandResult` due to its simplicity and the intended effects are clear. Furthermore, this is in line with how `HelpCommand` and `ExitCommand` is implemented.

##### Design Considerations

**Aspect: The method used to change view panels**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Pass the specific view through `CommandResult` using enum `CommandSpecific`. 
    - Pros: Simple and clear. It is also in line with how some other commands are implemented, and is the most natural manner to communicate with the UI from the Logic.
    - Cons: If we have too many views, we will need a lot of different `CommandSpecific`. Furthermore, our switch statements may get bloated.
- **Alternative 2:** Use listeners on the model. For example, we can have listeners on `filteredClients` to change views when changes happen on `filteredClients`.
    - Pros: Cleaner design. We will not need a separate enum.
    - Cons: Harder to implement. Increases coupling as well, as `Model` skips communications through `Logic` to get `UI` to change views directly, which is not in line with the architecture diagram.

- Ultimately, we believe that we will not have too many views (likely a maximum of 6 as we only have to consider `Client`, `Meeting`, `Product` and their detailed variant). As such, we felt that passing the `CommandSpecific` is a cheaper (in terms of effort and programming hours and research) and better solution for now.

**Aspect: Different view panels do not inherit from a single abstract panel class**

- View panels include not only `ListPanel`, but also `DetailedViewPanel`.
- Within in view panel class, there are similar structures (FXML file name attribute, Logger, ListView, constructor, overwriting ListCell etc.), but that is where the similarities end. We feel that having the panels inherit from a single panel does not necessarily add any value, as they do not share any attribute or methods. We find that the use of polymorphism here to make all the different view panels inherit from a single parent class is an example of over engineering and adds no value to justify the effort of doing so.
- Only within the three `ListPanel`, there is a single common method `numRecordsString`, which checks for plurality of the word 'record'. As such, a small bit of polymorphism in an abstract class `ListPanel` is incorporated in an attempt to reduce repetition.

### 4.5 Proposed Features

#### 4.5.1 Multiple possible prefixes per command

Purpose: With this proposed feature, users can have multiple possible prefixes for defining fields in a command.
For example, currently in _MyInsuRec_ we can define a client's birthday using the `b/` prefix only.
However, since a birthday is essentially a date, a user may prefer to reuse the `d/` prefix instead for defining a client's birthday(see `addMeeting` command).

##### Proposed Implementation

Currently, in _MyInsuRec_, `AddClientCommandParser` depends on multiple `Prefix` objects such as `PREFIX_BIRTHDAY`, and `PREFIX_DATE` to identify each field in an `AddClientCommand`.
Also, the `Prefix` class stores the required prefix word as a `String`.

In this proposed implementation, we instead change the prefix word stored in `Prefix` class to a `Pattern` which can be matched against using `Matcher` class.
Then, for all prefixes we are looking for, we first get the matching pattern using `getPrefix()`.
Later, `findPrefixPosition()`  validates the presence of a field and also obtains the index of its first occurrence.
From then on, the `AddClientCommand` can be built as expected.

<img src="images/ProposedPrefixSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />
g
##### Design Considerations for Proposed Feature

**Aspect: How prefixes are stored:**

- **Alternative Solution 1 (preferred choice for proposed feature):** `Prefix::getPrefix` returns a `Pattern` that `findPrefixPosition()` can match against using `Matcher` class (see diagram below).
- Pros: `Matcher` has several useful methods for validating a match.
- Case-insensitive matches can be made easily by setting a flag in the `Pattern`.
- Cons: Regex string used to define a pattern may be difficult to read. 
  - e.g. `String regexForBirthday = "[b|d|birthday|birthdate][\\\\]"` is not as clear as Alternative 2
- **Alternative Solution 2:** Store each possible prefix as a `String` in a `List` maintained by `Prefix`.
- Pros: `String` matches are easier to understand than regexes.
  - e.g. `String[] patternsForBirthday = {"b", "d", "birthday", "birthdate"}` are all possible prefixes and can be used to check for finding matches. 
- Cons: `List` of `String` returned is cumbersome for pattern matching, i.e. Iterate through every `String` in `patternsForBirthday` to look for a match.
- **Solution 1** is the preferred proposed feature because: 
  - A single `Pattern` for each `Prefix` is more succinct that a `List`.
  - No need to iterate through a list of `Strings` to find a match.
  - Matches can be made using pre-existing methods in `Matcher` class (no need to rely on `String` methods)

## 7. Appendix: Instructions for manual testing

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### 7.1 Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch
   * Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder.
   * Run the jar file via `java -jar MyInsuRec.jar` 
       * Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample clients and products. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences
    * Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.
    * Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.
        * Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

3. Subsequent launches, with data edited
    * Run the jar file via `java -jar MyInsuRec.jar`
        * Expected: Shows the GUI with the correct edited data.

### 7.2 Adding a client

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The function works regardless of the view you are currently in.</div>

1. Prerequisites: No other client have the exact same name.

2. Add client with only essential information
    * Test case: `addClient n/John Tan p/89134083`
        * Expected: A client named John Tan and phone number 89134083 is added and the view switches back to the list of client, where the list is updated with John Tan's newly added record.

3. Add client with same phone number as another client
    * Test case: `addClient n/Trevor Tan p/89134083`
        * Expected: A client named Trevor Tan and phone number 89134083 is added and the view switches back to the list of client, where the list is updated with Trevor Tan's newly added record. This test case focuses on the fact that the phone numbers are identical, which happens when parents buy policies for their child who does not have a cellular plan.

4. Add duplicate client of the same name
    * Test case: `addClient n/Trevor Tan p/89134083`
        * Expected: No client is added and an error message is shown. This tests whether if the app allows clients of the same name, which is not allowed by design.

5. Add client with an optional field
    * Test case: `addClient n/Justin Lim p/98120931 e/justinlim@gmail.com`
        * Expected: A client named Justin Lim and phone number 98120931 is added and the view switches back to the list of client, where the list is updated with Justin Lim's newly added record. This test case focuses on the fact that an optional field is used.

6. Add client with a non-existent product
    * Test case: `addClient n/Tom p/90231494 pd/ProductTest`
        * Expected: No client is added as the product `ProductTest` is not added beforehand.

7. Add client with an existing product
    * Continuation: `addProduct pd/ProductTest`, then `addClient n/Tom p/90231494 pd/ProductTest` again.
        * Expected: The client should now be added with the product as the product is added with the `addProduct` command.

8. Add client with no name prefix, `/n`
    * Test case:  `addClient Tom p/12345678`
        * Expected:  No client will be added. Error regarding the command format will be shown.

9. Add client with special character in name
    * Test case: `addClient n/O'neal p/12345678`
        * Expected: No client will be added. Error regarding the wrong name input will be shown.

10. Add client with invalid phone number
    * Test case: `addClient n/Tom p/12345`
        * Expected: No client will be added. Error regarding the wrong phone input will be shown.

### 7.3 Viewing a client

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The function works regardless of the view you are currently in, but it only makes sense to use while you are in the list of clients using `listClient` where the index number of the client can be found.

</div>

1. Prerequisites: View a specific client's details using the `viewClient` command. There is exactly one client in the list.

2. View client at index 1
    * Test case: `viewClient i/1`
        * Expected: The details of the client who is at the first index is shown.

3. View client using non-numeric index
    * Test case: `viewClient i/a`
        * Expected: The index is not numeric, so there will be an error.

4. View client using an index out of range
    * Test case: `viewClient i/2`
        * Expected: Index is larger than the size of client list, so there will be an error.

5. View client using index 0
    * Test case: `viewClient i/0`
        * Expected: Index less than 1 is not allowed, therefore there will be an index error.

6. View client without providing index
    * Test case: `viewClient i/`
        * Expected: Index is not provided, so there will be an error.

7. View client without using prefix
    * Test case: `viewClient 1`
        * Expected: Prefix for index is not provided, so there will be an invalid command format error.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The function works regardless of the view you are currently in.</div>

1. Prerequisites: No other product have the exact same name.

2. Add product with valid name
   * Test case: `addProduct pd/MyInsureCare`
     * Expected: A product named MyInsureCare is added and the view switches back to the list of product, where the list is updated with the newly added product.

3. Add product with empty field
   * Test case: `addProduct pd/`
     * Expected: Empty fields are not allowed, so no product is added.

### 7.9 Listing products

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The function works regardless of the view you are currently in.</div>

1. List all meetings
   * Test case: `listProduct`
     * Expected: The list of product view shows up.

2. List all meetings, with extra nonsensical parameters
   * Test case: `listProduct adfafio3`
     * Expected: The list of product view shows up. Any other parameter or input added after the command is ignored.

### 7.10 Delete product

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The function works regardless of the view you are currently in, but it only makes sense to use while you are in the list of products using `listProduct` where the index number of the product can be found.</div>

1. Prerequisites: There is at least one product already added.

2. Delete product at index 1
   * Test case: `delProduct i/1`
     * Expected: The list of product view shows up (if not already in it), and the first product is deleted.

3. View product with non-positive index
   * Test case: `delProduct i/-1`
     * Expected: No product is deleted and an error message shows up as the index is invalid.

## 8. Appendix: Effort

_MyInsuRec_ is a brown-field project that extends from AB3. It is developed to become a financial advisor's everyday companion app, used for its client contacts tracking, meetings scheduling and products management ability.

Our team has put in a substantial effort in developing this product. To date, we have over [12,000 lines of code](https://nus-cs2103-ay2223s1.github.io/tp-dashboard/?search=w16-4&sort=groupTitle&sortWithin=title&timeframe=commit&mergegroup=&groupSelect=groupByRepos&breakdown=true&checkedFileTypes=docs~functional-code~test-code~other&since=2022-09-16). Over 380 automated tests were written, and many hours of writing code and testing them was spent on this.

We have listed our project challenges below in an attempt to bring you closer to the behind-the-scenes of the product development, and help you understand the countless hours and the thoughts put into designing and creating the product.

### 8.1 Product challenges

Some design considerations and effort is listed below:

* Careful deliberation on how we can maintain the immutability of all three entity types to match the design of AB3. This was **especially challenging as we planned for `Client` and `Meeting` to have a bidirectional navigability so that we can freely access both object's information, but this is impossible** (literally) as there are no order of creation such that both objects can be immutable. We ultimately settled on a immutable definition that is less strict, and allows `Client` to have an immutable attribute of a list of meetings, but strictly control the ways that the list can be changed.

* Integrating the 3 entity types is also challenging as the initial code base is written purely for a single entity. We had to **spend hours researching on the use of Jackson** to better understand how we can incorporate navigability e.g., having `Client` have a reference to `Meeting` and kept inside to-and-fro storage. We ultimately decided on using an ID generator in order to reference from `Client` to its `Meeting`.

* Having 3 entity type also meant that all 3 view panels in the UI needed to be constantly synchronized with one another. This was more complex than we imagined, as the code base only has event listeners on the `ObservableList` which is created as a separate copy from the `FilteredList`. This meant that any mutations to the object will not trigger an update to the UI. That observation alone took us **hours googling and reading JavaFx documentations and fiddling through the AB3 code base** to figure out why mutations does not cause UI changes. We had to revert some decisions made earlier and revamp the entire code base to be fully immutable for the UI updates to work as intended

* 3 entity types also meant **triple the testing required**. Not just in automated testing, but also in integration test, where we had to ensure that all 3 entities can work together and stay synchronized. For example, ensuring that deletion of 1 entity meant the proper deletion of all the other associated entities.

* Having 3 entity types also mean that our GUI needed to switch between multiple panels. We had to implement all the different types of possible panels for the 3 entity, plus even more panels due to further variants of the list panel (e.g., detailed view panel). This poised some challenge for our team as we had to take the time to learn JavaFx, which was a library we were initially not adept at using.

* We implemented meetings with start and end time. Without the availability of interval trees in Java, it was more difficult than expected to ensure that meetings do not have any timing conflicts. We **faced a lot of bugs** in between trying to get the start and end time duration feature to work, facing regressions after fixing a bug. We eventually managed to produce a version that is relatively bug-free after many iterations spent.

* We have some attributes for clients optional, which is unlike AB3 where only `Tag` is optional. For AB3, the optional `Tag` is easily implemented as it is implemented as a Set which can simply be empty. For our attributes which are not in a form of data structure, we had to deliberate over how it should be implemented. For example, should it just be a barebones, empty parameter version of the attribute (which was the initial solution used)? How would that affect the software engineering principles that are taught? We eventually settled on the use of Java' Optional which suited our needs better, after facing bugs with using the barebones version of an attribute.
