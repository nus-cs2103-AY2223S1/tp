### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/gim/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/gim/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `:del 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/gim/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ExerciseListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/gim/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Exercise` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/gim/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ExerciseTrackerParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an exercise).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute(":del 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `:del 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ExerciseTrackerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ExerciseTrackerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/gim/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the exercise tracker data i.e., all `Exercise` objects (which are contained in a `ExerciseList` and `ExerciseHashMap` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Exercise` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Exercise>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/gim/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both exercise tracker data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ExerciseTrackerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `gim.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### **Exercise**

#### Implementation
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

An `Exercise` is stored in `ExerciseList` and `ExerciseHashmap` of Model

An `Exercise` contains the following attributes:
1. a `Name`, which represents the name of the Exercise
2. a `Weight`, which represents the total weight used for a certain Exercise
3. a `Reps`, which represents the number of times a specific exercise was performed
4. a `Sets`, which represents the number of cycles of reps that was completed
5. a `Date`, which represents the date an exercise was performed

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Date Implementation**

<img src="images/DateClassDiagram.png" width="250" />

The default format for date follows `dd/MM/uuuu`. `uuuu` is chosen over `yyyy` because this avoids unexpected exceptions
under strict parsing by the Java API `DateTimeFormatter`, such as those exceptions related to year-of-era.

The validity of a given date string depends on two factors: (1) Regex formatting and (2) Non-existent date checking.

1. For the regex formatting, the Singleton class `RegexList` contains a `List<String>` called `regexList` that contains the
accepted regex strings. The method `isValidDateByRegex` iterates through `regexList` to check whether a given date string
follows any of the accepted regex strings.

2. For the non-existent date checking, the Singleton class `FormatterList` contains a `List<String>` called `formatterList`
that contains the accepted date patterns. The private constructor of this class uses stream mapping to obtain a `List<DateTimeFormatter>`
called `formatterList` containing `DateTimeFormatter` objects that follows strict date validity check using
`ResolverStyle.STRICT`.

The Singleton pattern is used here to prevent multiple instantiation of this class.
1. The drawbacks of using this pattern is not really pronounced as there are not many classes having them as dependencies (only the `Date` class).
Therefore, coupling within the code base will not increase much.
2. Testing will not be affected by the fact that singleton objects carry data from one test to another because there is no mutation
of data inside the singleton objects `RegexList` and `FormatterList`. All tests will have the same singleton objects used.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Fields of Exercise are Final**
* **Current choice**: The aforementioned fields in `Exercise` are final, effectively making our Exercise class immutable.
  * Rationale: Code written with immutable objects is easier to reason with and easier to understand, facilitating a smoother process when it comes to debugging and testing any code related to `Exercise`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Exercise Hashmap**

#### Implementation
The Exercise Hashmap stores data in the form of a hashmap, where the key of the hashmap is the `Name` of an `Exercise` and its associated value is an `Exercise` ArrayList, containing a list of exercises (with the same name).

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Choosing the Data Structure**
* **Current choice**: We decided to use a hashmap data structure.
  * Rationale: We wanted to create associations between exercises with the same name. Utilising a hashmap structure, we can easily identify and retrieve exercises with the same exercise name (by their unique key identifier). Hence, this facilitates commands that rely on this retrieval to be implemented, such as [Listing of Personal Records](#listing-of-personal-records) and [Generating a suggested workout routine](#generating-a-suggested-workout-routine).

### **Sorting Exercise List**

#### Implementation

The sorting of exercise list is facilitated by `ModelManager` which implements `Model`. `ModelManager` contains a `filteredExercises`
list which is the list of exercises in a `FilteredList` 'wrapper' from `javafc.collections.transformation`. `filteredExercises`
gets the list of exercises to be displayed from method `getExerciseList()` in `ExerciseTracker`.

`ExerciseTracker` has method `sortDisplayedList()` which calls `sortDisplayedList()` in `ExerciseList`.

`ExerciseList` contains a `displayedList` of type `ObservableList<Exercise>` and is the list that will be displayed by the `Ui`.
It is a duplicated copy of the `internalUnmodifiableList` of type `unmodifiableObservableList`. `ExerciseList` has method
`sortDisplayedList()` which sorts the `displayedList` by order of date using the `sort()` method in `java.util.Collections` with a `Comparator<Exercise>`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Execution**

When the command `:sort` is entered, the `Ui` sends the command to `Logic`. `Logic` parses and identifies the `:sort` command that was entered, and creates
an instance of it. `Logic` then executes the command. `Model` will have the displayed list sorted and the sorted list will be displayed by `Ui`.

**Example Usage**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application which loads the set of exercises previously keyed. `displayedList` will be initialised
to be the same as the `internalUnmodifiableList` in `ExerciseList` where the exercises are sorted by the date of input.

Step 2: The user executes `:sort` command to sort the exercises based on date of exercises done. The `ExerciseTrackerParser`
identifies that the command is a `SortCommand`. The command calls `Model` to `sortDisplayedList` and the `Ui` displays the
`displayedList` which has the exercises sorted by their respective dates.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort command is executed.

<img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Displayed List structure**
* **Current choice**: `displayedList` is a duplicated copy of the list of exercises in `internalUnmodifiableList` of type
  `UnmodifiableObservableList` in `ExerciseList` class
    * Rationale: The sort command will sort the `diplayedList`, not affecting the `internalUnmodifiableList`. This allows
      users to view the sorted list of exercises while maintaining a defensive copy of exercises keyed by user.

**Aspect: Open-Closed Principle**
* **Current choice**: `sortDisplayedList()` in `ExerciseList` sorts the `displayedList` using the `sort()` method in `java.util.Collections` and a `Comparator<Exercise>`.
    * Rationale: Using a `Comparator<Exercise>` in `sort()` allows one to extend the `sortDisplayedList` method to accommodate other sorting orders
      by simply changing the `Comparator<Exercise>` used should the sorting criteria change in the future.

### **Viewing exercises within a date range**

#### Implementation

* `ExerciseTrackerParser` calls `RangeCommandParser#parse`.
* `RangeCommandParser#parseArguments` will return an enum type `Variation` according to the arguments in the
`ArgumentMultimap` created.
* When we obtain `Variation.ONE`, `RangeCommandParser#getVariationOne` will be called. 
  * In this case, the arguments expected to be inside the `ArgumentMultimap` will be the start date and
    end date.
* When we obtain `Variation.TWO`, `RangeCommandParser#getVariationTwo` will be called.
    * In this case, we expect the number of days to be the only argument inside `ArgumentMultimap`.
* `ParserUtil#parseDate` will be called to obtain the `Date` object(s).
* `RangeCommand` is returned.
* Then, the `execute()` method of the resulting `RangeCommand` object will be called, returning a
`CommandResult` object with the appropriate message.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Execution**

When the command `:range start/START_DATE end/END_DATE` or `:range last/NUMBER_OF_DAYS` is entered, the `Ui` sends 
the command to `Logic`. `LogicManager` parses and identifies the `:range` command that was entered, and creates an instance of it.

`LogicManager` then executes the command by calling `execute()` in `RangeCommand`.

`RangeCommand` will call the method `sortFilteredExerciseList(predicate)` defined in `Model`. This will cause
`filteredExercises` in `ModelManager` to be filtered according to the predicate `DateWithinRangePredicate`.
The resulting list will only include exercise entries that have dates between the start date (inclusive) and
end date (inclusive), arranged from the most recent first. If two exercise entries have the same date,
they will be sorted in alphabetical order.

`Model` will have the list sorted and the sorted list will be displayed by `Ui`.

**Example Usage**

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the date range view mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application which loads the set of exercises previously keyed.

Step 2: The user executes `:range start/10/10/2022 end/15/10/2022` command to view all the exercises done between
10 October 2022 and 15 October 2022. The `ExerciseTrackerParser` identifies that the command is a `RangeCommand`.
The command calls `Model` to `sortFilteredExerciseList(predicate)` and the `Ui` displays the `filteredExercises` list which has all the exercises between the specified dates.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the date range process is executed.

<img src="images/RangeSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Simplicity of command design**
* **Current choice**: The two variations of the `:range` command uses the same keyword but with different expected arguments.
This reduces the number of command keywords the user needs to remember when using the app.
* **Alternative choice**: Instead of using `:range` for both variations, another keyword such as
`:rangeLast` could be used in addition to `:range`. The drawback for this design choice is that
it goes against the simplicity of command design where the set of command keywords should be minimised where possible.

**Aspect: Enum types are used to indicate the variations**
* **Current choice**: Within `RangeCommandParser`, the enum `Variation` has only two values: `ONE` and `TWO` to represent
`:range` command variation one and two respectively. This ensures that the value representing the command variation cannot be anything not defined in the enum type.
Adding new variations is also easily done by adding another value inside the enum type.

### **Listing of Personal Records**

#### Implementation

The mechanism for listing Exercise personal record(s) is facilitated by `PrCommand`, which extends from `Command`.

It implements the following operations:

* `PrCommand#execute()`Executes and coordinates the necessary objects and methods to list personal record(s).
* `PrCommandParser#parse()`Parses user input from UI and initialises a PrCommand object.

The user can choose to view personal record(s) for specific exercises with the 'n/' prefix:
* `:pr n/NAME1 [n/NAME2 n/NAME3 ...]`

The user can also choose to view personal records for ALL exercises with the 'all/ prefix':
* `:pr all/`

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Example Usage**

Given below is an example usage scenario for how the mechanism for listing Exercise personal record(s) behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and already has 4 Exercise instances, with two unique Exercises (Squat and Deadlift), in the exercise tracker.

Step 2: The user enters the command `:pr n/Squat` to view their personal record for the exercise 'Squat'.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `PrCommand` works.

![ListPersonalRecordSequenceDiagram](images/ListPersonalRecordSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Type of arguments to accept**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Accept exercise names.
    * Pros: Being able to view and list personal records by Exercise name is more intuitive and convenient, especially since all unique Exercises are listed in the UI (bottom right).
    * Cons: Would require users to type more characters; also require users to enter exercise names accurately.

* **Alternative 2**: Accept index as arguments.
    * Pros: Suggestions are generated based on PR recorded by the app. As such, the input exercise(s) must already exist in the app. Accepting indexes would guarantee this condition.
    * Cons: May require users to scroll to locate index of desired exercise, when the number of exercises grow.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Generating a suggested workout routine**

#### Implementation

Workout suggestions are suggested by `Generator` objects. The suggestion mechanism follows the command pattern. The `GeneratorFactory` creates a concrete `Generator` object, and passes it to the `GenerateCommand` object, which treats all generators as a general `Generator` type. `GenerateCommand` is able to get a workout suggestion without knowledge of the type of generator. The following class diagram illustrates this.

![GeneratorCommandPattern](images/GeneratorCommandPattern.png)

The mechanism for generating a suggested workout routine is facilitated by `GenerateCommand`, which extends from `Command`.

It implements the following operations:

* `GenerateCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes and coordinates the necessary objects and methods to generate a suggested workout routine.
* `GenerateCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses user input from UI and initializes a GenerateCommand object.

Cases such as where the index from the user input is out of bounds, are handled by the methods.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Example Usage**

Given below is an example usage scenario for how the mechanism for generating a workout routine behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, and already has 2 exercises, squat and deadlift, at index 1 and 2, in the exercise tracker.

Step 2: The user enters the command `:gen 1,2 level/easy` to generate an easy workout routine consisting of the exercises squat and deadlift.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `GenerateCommand` works.
A `Name` object `exerciseName` is returned to `g:GenerateCommand` by calling a method in `:Model`. 
For the sake of brevity, this interaction is omitted from the diagram.

![GenerateWorkoutSequenceDiagram](images/GenerateWorkoutSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The diagram below illustrates the interaction between `g:GenerateCommand` and `GeneratorFactory` class.
The static method `GeneratorFactory#getGenerator()` creates a `Generator` of the correct difficulty level, such as `EasyGenerator`.
The number of `Generator` objects created is equal to the number of unique exercise names. They are `s:EasyGenerator` and `d:EasyGenerator` for squat and deadlift respectively.

![GetSuggestionSequenceDiagram](images/GetSuggestionSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The sd frame should capture the entire diagram here, but due to a limitation of PlantUML, it appears as such.

</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Number of `Generator` objects:**
* **Current choice**: Pairing each unique exercise to one `Generator`.
    * Rationale: The current `:gen` command specifies a single difficulty level for all exercises listed in the command. A possible extension in the future would be to allow each exercise to be linked to its own difficulty level, for example, `:gen deadlift/easy squat/hard`. This design would make such an implementation possible.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **Listing of unique stored Exercises in a graphical UI**

#### Implementation

The display window is located in the bottom right of the application. The display mechanism has been implemented with the Observer design pattern in mind.

It is primarily driven by `SavedExerciseListWindow` (which holds the UI for the display). The logic is
handled by `ExerciseKeys` and `ExerciseHashMap`.

**General class diagram**

The `SavedExerciseListWindow` class implements the `Observer` interface as it is the observer. The `ExerciseHashMap` class maintains an internal ArrayList of type `Observer`, which can be modified through the addUI function. As the UI elements are usually initialized later than the data on loading of the application, the `SavedExerciseListWindow`UI object is only added as an observer after its constructor is called. This guards against any null-pointer exceptions which may occur when preloading data from a hashmap in storage.

![ObserverPatternClass](images/ObserverPattern.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Subscribing to updates**

Once the `SavedExerciseListWindow` object has been added to the arraylist of `Observer` in the  `ExerciseHashMap`, it 'subscribes' to notifications whenever the ExerciseHashMap changes. Based on the functionality of the Hashmap as well as the application, this can be generalised into two distinct scenarios.

* **Adding an exercise** - Whenever a new exercise has been added, there is a possibility of a new key being added.
* **Removing an exercise** - Whenever a new exercise has been removed, there is a possibility of a key being removed permanently.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The current implementation subscribes to notification for any form of addition or deletion, regardless if the exercise is unique or already exists in the list.
</div>

**Updating**

Whenever there is a state changing operation, the `ExerciseHashMap` object will notify all observers through the notifyObservers method. All Observers in the list will run the update method that is individually specified in their class. As such , all Observers of ExerciseHashMap are required to override the update method as shown below.

```
    @Override
    public void update() {
        .
        unique implementation detail here... 
        . 
    }
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Below is a sample sequence diagram for the current implementation of how notifyObservers work.

![NotifyObservers](images/NotifyObservers.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Currently, there is only SavedExerciseListWindow observing the ExerciseHashMap
</div>

The logic behind the calculations and formatting of the display message is handled by the `ExerciseKeys` class.

Through this pattern, each observer gets to define exactly what the required display/result should be.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Polymorphism**
* The immediately apparent benefit of this design would be the Polymorphism that it capitalises on. In particular, the notifyObservers function in `ExerciseHashMap`.

```
    public void notifyObservers() {
        for (Observer o: observerArrayList) {
            o.update();
        }
    }
```

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* Notice that `ExerciseHashMap` does not know the nature of the observers and how they interact with it. `ExerciseHashMap` only stores a list of the objects observing it. It does not have to define what they should do to update, instead, the responsibility of deciding what to do is passed on to the Observers themselves.

* This allows for flexibility in having different types of objects having different forms of updating. This keeps the code in `ExerciseHashMap` short and hides the implementation of the Observers behind the `Observer` interface which acts as an intermediary to help the UI communicate with `ExerciseHashMap`.
