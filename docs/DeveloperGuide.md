### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteC 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. 
Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/2da571e65f2e2ae194a9176540e47967a6402ac8/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person`, `Task`, and `Tag` objects residing in the `Model`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/2da571e65f2e2ae194a9176540e47967a6402ac8/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteC 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deleteC 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommand` and `CommandResult` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddContactCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteContactCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/2da571e65f2e2ae194a9176540e47967a6402ac8/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramPerson.png" width="450" />
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramTaskTag.png" width="450" />
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object),
all `Task` objects (which are contained in a `TaskList` object), and all `Tag` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTagList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
The same goes for `Task` and `Tag`.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-4/tp/blob/2da571e65f2e2ae194a9176540e47967a6402ac8/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

### Entity specific classes

Yellowbook has 3 primary entities: 'Person', 'Task', and 'Tag', these are represented by classes with the respective names. The 'Tag' class provides a label for `Person(s)` and `Task(s)`.

These are the specifications for the fields of 'Person' and 'Task'.

#### Person

Each field is implemented by a class with the same name, except for `Id` which is implemented using Java UUID class.

Id is unique and automatically generated when person is added.

Persons with the same fields for email, phone or ID are not allowed.
In real life, these fields are very likely unique for each individual, so there should not be a situation where two contacts have the same data in any of these fields. Duplicate names are allowed as there may be multiple people with the same name.

| Field Name | Description                                    | Constraints                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |

#### Task

Each field is implemented by a class with the same name.

Id is unique and automatically generated when task is added.
Tasks with the same fields in all of description, deadline and tag are not allowed.
This is because two tasks would be considered the same if they were the same task with the same deadline and labels.
As we are maintaining a unique task list in our app, this is disallowed.

| Field Name        | Description                                                                        | Constraints                                                     |

| Completion Status | Completion status of task, defaults to false (not complete) when new task is added | Boolean (Completed or Not Complete)                             |
| Archival Status   | Archival status of task, defaults to false (not archived) when new task is added   | Boolean (Archived or Not Archived)                              |
| Tag               | Defaults to empty set when new task is added                                       | Zero or more tag(s), each following the constraint of a Tag     |

#### Tag

Each Tag is implemented by the class "Tag". Tags are non-empty alphanumeric strings (no spaces allowed) and can be associated with both Persons and Tasks.

Tags must be unique, tags with same characters but in different cases are considered distinct. (e.g. Tag `cs2103t` and `CS2103T` are considered different and hence allowed )

Tags, unlike Persons and Tasks, do not have an Id. This is because Tags should not have the same names and hence the name itself is sufficient to identify a Tag.

Tags also include a count field. Each tag keeps track of the total number of times it is applied to either a contact or a task.
This count updates dynamically in response to user input.
For example, if a contact with multiple tags is deleted, the count in each of these tags will be decremented by one.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add/delete tag feature

#### Implementation

The add/delete tag mechanism operates for both contacts and tasks in YellowBook.

Every instance of AddTagCommand and DeleteTagCommand is created with two booleans.
For AddTagCommand, they are addTagToTask and addTagToContact.
For DeleteTagCommand, they are removeTagFromTask and removeTagFromContact.
Only one of these booleans will be true. Otherwise, an exception is thrown.

Depending on the status of these booleans, an EditTaskDescriptor or EditPersonDescriptor is created respectively.

This descriptor object is then used to modify the list of tags attached to the selected task/contact.

A new contact/task is created, with all attributes copied over from the original person, except for the list of tags, where the modified version is used.

This contact/task then replaces the previous contact/task in the YellowBook via `AddressBook#setPerson()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/delete tag mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `addL c/1 t/CS2103T` to add the tag "CS2103T" to the first contact in the contact list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The above command will fail if the contact list is empty. An error message will be displayed informing the user.

</div>

Step 2. The user now decides that adding the tag was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing `deleteT c/1 l/CS2103T`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The tag provided in the `deleteL` command must be an exact match for that provided in the `addL` command. Matching is case-sensitive. Otherwise, YellowBook will display an error message stating that no such tag is present on the selected user.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the add tag operation works:

![AddTagSequenceDiagram](images/AddTagSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddTagCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How add & delete tag executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a static class to edit tag list.
  * Pros: Preserves immutability of Contact and Task.
  * Cons: Longer code, requires writing a new class.

* **Alternative 2:** Use the existing EditContact and EditTask classes.
    * Pros: Requires no additional code.
    * Cons: Increases coupling. Will fail if the associated classes stop working.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Add/delete task feature

#### Implementation

The add/delete task mechanism is facilitated by `TaskList`. It extends `AddressBook` with a task list, stored internally as a TaskList `tasks`.

Every instance of AddTaskCommand is created with a Task instance. If the Task instance is null, an exception is thrown.

Every instance of DeleteTaskCommand is created with an Index instance.

Additionally, TaskList implements the following operations:

* `TaskList#addTask()`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a task to the task list.
* `TaskList#remove()`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes the specified task from the task list.
* `TaskList#setTask()`â€‰â€”â€‰Replaces the task in the list with an edited task.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addTask()`, `Model#deleteTask()` and `Model#setTask()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/delete task mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `TaskList` will be initialized and contains no tasks.

Step 2. The user executes `addT d/buy milk D/12-09-2022` command to add a task to the task list. The `addT` command calls `Model#addTask()`, causing the task to be added to the task list.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The addT command will fail its execution if its format is incorrect, and no task will be added to the task list. An error message will be displayed informing the user.

</div>

Step 3. The user now decides that adding that task was a mistake, and decides to remove that task by executing `deleteT 1` to delete the first task in the task list. The `delete` command calls `Model#deleteTask()`, causing the first task in the task list to be deleted.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The deleteT command will fail its execution if the index provided is invalid, and no task will be removed from the task list. An error message will be displayed informing the user.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the addT operation works:

![AddTaskSequenceDiagram](images/AddTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddTaskCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/AddTaskActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How add & delete task executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a TaskList class to handle the task list.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: The code becomes longer as a new class must be implemented.

* **Alternative 2:** Use the existing AddressBook class to store the Tasks.
    * Pros: Does not require implementation of a new class.
    * Cons: Increases complexity and length of code in AddressBook.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find contact feature

#### Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate`. It implements `Predicate<Person>`, which means it is a functional interface that tests a person object against a condition. The `test` method returns true if the person object contains any of the keywords given by the user.

Every instance of `FindContactCommand` is created with a `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` instance which encapsulates the keywords given by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user enters with findC command with one or more of the contact's fields as parameters (e.g. name, address, phone, email)

Step 2. The `FindContactCommandParser` class parses the user input and creates a `PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the given parameters.

Step 3. The `FindCommand` class then calls the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` method with the predicate object as the parameter.

Step 4. The `Model` class then updates the filtered list of contacts in the `AddressBook` class.

![FindContactSequenceDiagram](images/FindContactSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The find task feature uses the same mechanism as the find contact feature, except that it uses classes and methods for `Task` instead of `Person`.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the parameters supplied are matched to contact fields:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Matches individual words in the parameter to the contact fields (case insensitive)
    * Pros: Users are able to make more generic searches as only one word needs to match.
    * Pros: This is consistent behaviours of with popular search engines who do not search for exact matches by default.
    * Cons: Results are less precise as users are unable to search multi-word strings.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow users to specify which keywords are to be matched individually or in multi-word strings
    * Pros: Allow more precise searches.
    * Cons: User needs to remember additional syntax.
    * Cons: More complex implementation.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Mark/unmark task feature

#### Implementation

The mark/unmark task mechanism is facilitated by `TaskList` and updates a task's completion status to done and undone respectively.
The task completion status is stored internally in each `Task` object as a boolean variable `isDone`.

The mark/unmark mechanism makes use of the following operations:
- `TaskList#setTask(Task target, Task editedTask)` â€” Replaces task in the list with edited task.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#setTask(Task target, Task editedTask)`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the mark mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, which already has some tasks listed. The tasks' current completion status is as currently
stored in the boolean `isDone`.

Step 2. The user executes `markT 1` command to mark the 1st task in the address book's task list as done. The `markT` command
calls `Model#setTask(Task target, Task editedTask)`, updating the 1st task's boolean variable `isDone` as true.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The above command will fail if the task list is empty or the index given by the user is invalid.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the mark task operation works:

![MarkTaskSequenceDiagram](images/MarkTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `MarkTaskCommandParser` and `MarkTaskCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `unmarkT` command indicates a task as not done, and is executed similarly to the above sequence diagram, although with `UnmarkTaskCommandParser` and `UnmarkTaskCommand` instead of
`MarkTaskCommandParser` and `MarkTaskCommand` respectively.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/MarkUnmarkTaskActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How mark & unmark task executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Replaces task in tasklist.
    * Pros: Reflects change in GUI immediately.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of creating unnecessary new `Task` objects and numerous method calls to change the TaskList instead of just changing the Task.

* **Alternative 2:** Change the boolean variable of `Task` object directly.
    * Pros: Will be more efficient without needing to create new `Task` object and only needing to update the `isDone` variable of `Task` object.
    * Cons: GUI only reflects the change after the task list is update by another command.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sort feature

#### Implementation

The sort mechanism is facilitated by `TaskList` with the sorting status stored internally as `isSortByDeadline`. It implements the following operations:

* `TaskList#sortByDeadline()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the task list by deadline.
* `TaskList#sortById()`â€‰â€”â€‰Sorts the task list by id, which is the order the tasks were added in.

The two operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#sortByDeadline()` and `Model#sortById()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application with some tasks in the task list already.

Step 2. The user executes `sortD` command to sort the task list by deadline. The `sortD` command calls `Model#sortByDeadline()`, causing the task list to sort by deadline.
The following sequence diagram shows how the sort by deadline operation works:

![SortByDeadlineSequenceDiagram](images/SortByDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The user has seen the most urgent tasks to be completed but realises that there is one more task that has not been added. The user executes `addT d/do â€¦` to add a new task.  The `addT` command eventually calls `TaskList#sortByDeadline()` to sort the task list after adding the new task.

Step 4. The user now decides that the initial order of the task list looks much better after finding out the tasks to do. The user executes `sortI` to sort the task list by id. The `sortI` command calls `Model#sortById()` to sort the task list based on id.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/SortActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the sort methods executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the sorting status after sorting
  * Pros: Only need to enter sort command once for task list to permanently be sorted even when the task list is modified.
  * Cons: Harder to implement as other task list need to be updated constantly to ensure sorting order.

* **Alternative 2:** Don't save the sorting status and just sort once
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: Need to type a sort command each time the list is changed to preserve sorting order.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 - Momento design pattern (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues due to higher memory usage.

* **Alternative 2 - Command design pattern:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command is correct.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Reminder feature

#### Implementation

The reminder mechanism is facilitated by `TaskUntilDeadlinePredicate`. It implements `Predicate<Task>`, which means it is a functional interface that tests a task object against a condition.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `TaskUntilDeadlinePredicate#test()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns true if the task object contains all the keywords given by the user.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the reminder mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, which already has some tasks with different deadlines listed.

Step 2. The user executes `remindT 12-09-2022` command to list tasks with deadlines up to and including the specified date. The `addT` command calls `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)`, which filters the task list by the given predicate.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The remindT command will fail its execution if its format is incorrect, and the task list will not be updated. An error message will be displayed informing the user.

</div>

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How remind task executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Implement a TaskUntilDeadlinePredicate class to handle creation of predicates for the ReminderCommand class.
    * Pros: Reduces dependency on other classes.
    * Pros: Abides by the Single Responsibility Principle.
    * Cons: The code becomes longer as a new class must be implemented.

* **Alternative 2:** Modify the PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate class to handle deadlines as well.
    * Pros: Does not require implementation of a new class.
    * Cons: The FilterTaskCommand and ReminderCommand classes become dependent on the modified PersonContainsKeywordsPredicate class. This increases coupling.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Task progress feature

#### Implementation

The task progress mechanism is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It implements `Model`.

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the filter of the filtered task list to filter by the given predicate.
* `ModelManager#getPercentageCompletion(Predicate<Task> predicate)`â€‰â€”â€‰Updates the filter of the filtered task list and returns the percentage of completed tasks.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the reminder mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application, which already has some tasks labelled with `cs2103t`.

Step 2. The user executes `progressT cs2103t` command to list all tasks with the label `cs2103t` and tells the user what percentage of tasks labelled `cs2103t` are marked as complete.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The progressT command will fail its execution if its format is incorrect, and the task list will not be updated. An error message will be displayed informing the user.

</div>

Step 3. The user executes `listT` command to list all tasks.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How task progress executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task> predicate)` to filter the task list.
    * Pros: The total number of tasks that need to be considered is the size of the filtered task list.
    * Pros: Only the tasks that need to be considered are in the filtered task list.
    * Cons: This increases coupling.

* **Alternative 2:** Check each task of the task list to see if it needs to be counted.
    * Pros: Reduces coupling.
    * Cons: This is inefficient and performance is likely to worsen as the task list grows in size.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `listC` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   1. Test case: `deleteC 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `deleteC 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `deleteC`, `deleteC x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

1. Deleting a person after executing a find command

   1. Prerequisites: Find multiple persons using the `findC` command. Multiple persons in the results of the find command.

   2. Test case: `deleteC 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the results of the find command. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.

   3. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `deleteC`, `deleteC x`, `...` (where x is larger than the results of the find command)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing data file

   1. Delete the data file in the file path of `yellowBooks.jar` (if-any). <br>

   2. Launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.
   
   3. Perform any command (e.g. `listT`).<br>
      Expected: A data file will be created in the directory `./data/yellowBook.json`. There will be some sample data.

1. Dealing with a corrupted data file

   1. Prerequisites: Have a existing data file in the directory `./data/yellowBook.json` and open it with a text editor.

   2. Edit the data file to contain invalid data (e.g. change a `phone` to contain alphabets ) and save it.<br>
      Expected: The app will show empty contact list, task list, and tag list when launched. 
    
   3. Close the app without performing any commands.
      Expected: The data file will still contain the corrupt data.

   4. Edit the data file to revert the data to the original state from step 1 and save it.<br>
      Expected: The app will show the orignal contact list, task list, and tag list when launched.
