### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delcus 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Customer` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCustomerCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a customer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delcus 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delcus 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCustomerCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCustomerCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCustomerCommandParser`, `DeleteCustomerCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the art buddy data i.e., all `Customer` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCustomerList` object).
* stores all `Commission` objects within their respective `Customer` object (which are contained in a `UniqueCommissionList` object).
* stores all `Iteration` objects within their respective `Commission` object (which are contained in a `UniqueIterationList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Customer` as an `ObservableObject<Customer>` respectively, which lets us listen to changes to the selected customer for performing UI updates.
  * the same applies to the currently selected `Commission`.
* stores the current 'sorted' and 'filtered' objects (sorted based on the `sortcus` or `find` commands) as a separate _sorted_ and _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Customer>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the current list of `Commission` objects belonging to the selected `Customer` (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Commission>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
* keeps track of the currently selected GUI tab using a `GuiTab` enum. The tab that the GUI displays is updated after each command is executed.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Customer` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Customer` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage` and `ImageStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one of them (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)
* handles the following image functionality:
  * loading of [`BufferedImage`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/image/BufferedImage.html) from a specified path in the image directory.
  * storing a [`BufferedImage`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.desktop/java/awt/image/BufferedImage.html) within the image directory.
  * :information_source: **Note:** the image directory (in which all images are stored) is defined by `imageBaseDirectoryPath` within [`UserPrefs.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/UserPrefs.java).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Commissions
The class diagram below shows our current implementation of the `Commission` class.

![CommissionClassDiagram](images/Commission.png)

Each commission in `ArtBuddy` contains...
- a `Title`
- a `Fee`
- a `Deadline`
- a `Completion Status`
- a `Set<Tags>` with any number of `Tag`s
- an *optional* `Description`
- a reference to its `Customer` object
- a `UniqueIterationList` containing its `Iteration`s

Commissions are currently stored in the individual `Customer`'s `UniqueCommissionList`.

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect 1: Location to store the commission objects**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Store all commission objects within their individual customer objects.
  * Pros:
    * Easy to implement.
    * Commands requiring commissions of a specific customer becomes more efficient.
  * Cons:
    * Commands requiring commissions from all customers are less efficient.
* **Alternative 2:** Store all commission objects in `AddressBook`.
  * Pros:
    * Commands requiring commissions from all customers can be more efficient.
  * Cons:
    * More difficult to implement, since a deleted customer's commissions has to be individually deleted from this master list of commissions.
    * Less efficient for commands for an individual customer's commissions.

**Aspect 2: How to store the commission objects in `Customer`**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):**  create a `UniqueCommissionList` class
  * Pros:
    * Supports indexing of commissions already, which is convenient for most of our commands.
  * Cons:
    * Another class is necessary.
* **Alternative 2:** Use `Set<Commissions>`
  * Pros:
    * Individual customers' data does not require "ordering". Sets thus provide more efficient add/delete/find operations.
  * Cons:
    * Does not support indexing. Would still need another data structure in `ModelManager` when commands request commissions by index.
    * Edit becomes tedious to implement as it requires a combination of create and delete.

#### Deleting a Commission (`delcom`)

Deletes a commission based on user input, and deletes the commission from the active customer.

##### Implementation
This section explains how the `delcom` command is implemented.

Support for the `delcom` command is integrated with `DeleteCommissionCommandParser` and `DeleteCommissionCommand`.

It is important to note that our commission commands usually require retrieving the customer to operate on the customer's
commission list directly, due to our method of storing commissions (inside their Customer objects).

1. User specified arguments (the commission index) are passed to the DeleteCommissionCommandParser and the arguments are broken up by the ArgumentTokenizer and ArgumentMultimap.

1. The arguments will then be parsed by ParserUtil. An error will be thrown if the inputs were invalid or if no customer is selected yet.

1. A new DeleteCommissionCommand object will be initialised.

1. DeleteCommissionCommand#execute() will then get the currently shown list of commissions and identify the target commission to delete.

1. The customer is retrieved from the reference stored in the Commission object.

1. This customer and target commission is passed into Model#removeCommission to be removed directly from the customer's commission list.

1. Model updates the GuiTab to show the Commission tab and selectedCommission to not show the deletedCommission and these changes are observed by the UI.

1. The success message will be returned to the user by the CommandResult.

The sequence diagram below shows the interaction between `Logic` and `Model` when `delcom 1` is executed.
The parser part is omitted for brevity, but it is very similar to the other commands.

![DeleteCommissionCommand](images/DeleteCommissionCommand.png)

### Iterations
Iterations help users keep track of the progress of their commissions. Each commission iteration
essentially represents a version of the commissioned artwork.

Iterations contain:
* a `Date`, which uses a `LocalDate` in its underlying implementation, representing the date
tied to the iteration
* an `IterationDescription`, which represents a textual description of the iteration
* a `Path`, which is the file path of an image representing the iteration artwork
* and a `Feedback`, which represents textual feedback to the iteration.

Since an iteration must be tied to a commission, this composition is captured by storing the
iterations in a `UniqueIterationList` inside the associated commission object.

![IterationClassDiagram](images/IterationClassDiagram.png)

#### Adding an Iteration (`additer`)
Adding an `Iteration` creates an iteration based on the user input, and adds the iteration to the
active commission. Like all other add commands, users may either add an iteration via the
command line or the GUI.

##### Implementation
Support for the add iteration command is integrated with the `AddIterationParser`,
which enables ArtBuddy to parse user input into an `AddIterationCommand`. The
`AddIterationCommand` stores the iteration created from the user inputs. This
iteration is added to the active commission's `UniqueIterationList` when the
`AddIterationCommand` is executed by the `LogicManager`.

Note that if there is no presently active commission, the iteration will not be added.

The sequence diagram below shows the interactions between the Logic, Model, and Storage components when
the user runs the command `additer d/2022-10-10 n/Changed the colour scheme p//Users/john/Downloads/Draft 1.png
f/Updated colour scheme is much better`.

##### Design Considerations
<table>
<tr><th colspan="4">Aspect 1: Image File Handling</th></tr>
<tr><th></th><th>Alternative</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td>
<td>Store and use the image at the file path specified in the <code>additer</code> command</td>
<td>Easy to implement</td><td>The user might modify the image at the given file path. For instance,
the image may be edited, renamed, moved, or entirely deleted.

This imposes the constraint on the user not to modify their files if they do not wish for
their files on ArtBuddy to be similarly modified, which is not ideal in most cases.

In addition, it exposes ArtBuddy to some vulnerabilities that may lead to unexpected behaviour.
For example, the user might change the file to an unsupported file type.

All these potential failures have to be gracefully handled- which poses a big challenge because
there are so many areas for error that some may be overlooked. Furthermore, many of these issues
might not have ideal solutions that do not diminish the user experience and are easy to implement.
</td>

</tr>
<tr><td>2</td>
<td>Make a defensive copy of the uploaded image <strong>(current)</strong></td>
<td>Making a defensive copy of the uploaded image in ArtBuddy protects the images used
in ArtBuddy from modification and the problems associated to user modification, as explained above.</td>
<td>Additional overhead will have to be added to the execution of <code>additer</code> commands,
because a copy of the image has to be made each time the command is executed.

Furthermore, it introduces deeper coupling between the `Logic` and `Storage` components since
the `AddIterationCommand` class in `Logic` would have to depend on `Storage` to copy the image into ArtBuddy.
</td>

severity of bugs that could have been introduced in ArtBuddy otherwise.</td></tr>

<table>
<tr><th colspan="4">Aspect 2: Image Copy File Naming</th></tr>
<tr><th></th><th>Alternative</th><th>Pros</th><th>Cons</th></tr>
<tr><td>1</td><td>Naming the copy of the image file with the original filename</td>
<td>-</td><td>There may be files with the same original file name. This could result
in duplicate filenames in the ArtBuddy storage folder, which is not allowed.</td></tr>

<tr><td>2</td><td>Creating sub-folders for each customer and commission, where the
image copy will be stored. The image copy files will be named after their iteration
description.</td><td>As iteration descriptions are guaranteed to be unique within each commission,
we can guarantee that all filenames within each folder will be unique.</td>
<td>Many nested folders would have to be created in ArtBuddy just to store iteration images.

In addition, it would introduce overheads into other commands, such as <code>deliter</code>
and <code>edititer</code> because the filenames of these files would have to be modified to
ensure they can be referenced to the correct iteration, and also avoid the issue with duplicate filenames.
Furthermore, iteration descriptions may contain characters that result in invalid filenames.
</td></tr>

<tr><td>3</td><td>Keeping a global count and naming the image copy file after its customer,
commission and this global count.</td><td>Each combination of customer name and commission title
is guaranteed to be unique.

Also, since there is a restriction on customer names and commission titles, they are suitable to be used as filenames.

Editing and deletion of iterations will not incur additional overheads as the unique global count
would ensure that each iteration image remains uniquely identifiable after these commands.
</td>

<td>Even though we are getting closer to a unique hash, editing and deletion of customers and commissions would
still be problematic. These commands still require the filenames to be renamed- else, they would risk facing the
same issue of duplicate filenames within the image storage folder.

In addition, the introduction of a global variable would introduce a high level of coupling.
</td>
</tr>

<tr><td>4</td><td>Use a randomly generated hash as the filename <strong>(current)</strong></td>
<td>High probability of the unique filenames.

Removed dependency on the state of the `Customer`, `Commission`, or `Iteration` object it belongs to.
Hence, no additional overhead will be incurred with delete or edit commands.
</td>
<td>While small, there is a non-zero probability of getting duplicate filenames</td>
</tr>
<tr><td colspan="4">Overall, the team agreed that using a randomly generated hash was definitely
the most elegant way of handling file naming. Furthermore, the tradeoffs are almost negligible
as duplicate filenames can be easily handled by generating a new hash until a unique filename is obtained.</td></tr>

1. Prerequisites: None.
1. Test case: `listcom`
   1. Expected: If a customer is selected, show all of customer's commissions. Otherwise, show all commissions.

##### 16. `allcom` Command
1. Prerequisites: None.
1. Test case: `allcom`
   1. Expected: Switched to Commission view. Commission List shows all commissions.

##### 17. `findcom` Command
1. Prerequisites: Similar to `find`, technically, none. However, having some commissions will make it easier to see the results of this command.
1. Test case: `findcom k/1`
   1. Expected: Switched to Commission view. All commissions with `1` in their name are displayed.


### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Prerequisites:
      1. There is a data file. By default, it should be at `data/artbuddy.json`
   1. Remove the starting `{`, then launch ArtBuddy.
   1. ArtBuddy's customer and commission list will all be empty. The corrupted data file will be overwritten when new
      customers are added to ArtBuddy.
   1. To restart the application with sample data, delete the corrupted json file and re-run the application.

## **Appendix: Effort**

A significant volume of effort was expended to develop ArtBuddy from the original AB3.
This is due to AB3 dealing primarily with only one entity Person while ArtBuddy deals with three entities, `Customer`,
`Commission` and `Iteration`.

### Major changes:
* Adding two entirely new entity types, `Commission` and `Iteration`
* Refactoring `Customer` and `Commission` to use the Builder Pattern to support optional arguments
* Supporting Images for `Iteration`
* Creating CRUD commands for the two completely new models, `Commission` and `Iteration`
* Designing `sort` command for `Customer` with many options for the user
* Implementing `find` commands for both `Customer` and `Commission` with added tag filtering functionality
* Redesigning the GUI

### Challenges faced:

#### Revamping the GUI
Amongst these changes, the most challenging change must be updating the GUI.

Firstly, ArtBuddy's three entities are very closely linked, with `Commission`s belonging to a `Customer` and
`Iteration`s belonging to a `Commission`. As a result, a lot of effort was expended to ensure the UI can properly
observe the models and filtered list. This is mostly facilitated by ArtBuddy's custom `ObservableObject` class.
A lot of listeners also had to be added in many parts of `Model` and `Ui` to ensure changes are properly propagated.

Secondly, ArtBuddy's GUI has changed significantly from the original AB3 GUI. Multiple new components have been added,
including tabs and split panes, pie charts for statistics, and even pop up windows and image drag and drop as an
alternate way of adding customers, commissions and iterations. There are also a lot of CSS changes to make the product
look more appealing to the user.

#### Creating new entities
`Commission` and `Iteration` are new entities and had to be written from scratch and integrated properly into all of
AB3's components, such as `Ui`, `Model`, `Storage` without breaking existing abstractions. The design had to clearly
thought out (e.g. which classes should help store the model and what methods are necessary) for easier implementation
of commands.

#### Implementing Images
Images for Iterations are a novel feature for ArtBuddy. There were many complications to consider:
* What if the file path is invalid?
* What if the file is not an image?
* What if the file is an image but not supported by JavaFx?
* What if the image file name is the same as another image?
* Images can have different dimensions. How should this be rendered in the GUI?

As a result, the implementation for this had to keep evolving in ArtBuddy, from a naive file copy to a more robust
implementation, a `SimpleImageStorage` class using classes such as `ImageIO` and `BufferedImage`.
