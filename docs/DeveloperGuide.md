### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a person

In TAB, the addition of a new `Person`(contact) is facilitated by the `AddCommand` command. `AddCommand` extends the abstract `Command` class,
where it overrides the `Command#execute` method to add in new contacts whenever called.

#### Implementation

1. The user input to add a `Person` to TAB, is passed to and executed by `LogicManager`, which calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to instantiate a `AddCommandParser`.
2. The `AddCommandParser#parse` will return a `AddCommand`, provided the user input is valid.
3. `LogicManager` will then call the `Command#execute` method of `AddCommand`,
creating a new `Person` through `Model#addPerson` method.
4. Upon successful execution of the command, a message will be displayed to the user, by returning a `CommandResult`
to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the command to add a `Person` works:

![AddCommandSequence](images/AddCommandSequence.png)

### Editing a contact

The editing of a contact's details in TAB is facilitated by the `EditCommand` command. `EditCommand` extends the abstract `Command` class,
where it overrides the `Command#execute` method to edit details of contacts whenever called.

#### Implementation

1. The user input to edit a contact on TAB, is passed to and executed by `LogicManager`, which calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to instantiate a `EditCommandParser`.
2. The `EditCommandParser#parse` will return a `EditCommand`, provided the user input is valid.
3. `LogicManager` will then call the `Command#execute` method of `EditCommand`,
   replacing the old `Person` with a modified `Person` through `Model#setPerson` method.
4. Upon successful execution of the command, a message will be displayed to the user, by returning a `CommandResult `
   to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the command to edit a `Person` works:

![EditCommandSequence](images/EditCommandSequence.png)

### Adding the attendance of a student

The addition of attendance of a `Student` in TAB is facilitated by `AttendanceCommand` and `AttendanceCommandParser`.

#### Implementation

1. The user input to add the attendance of a student in TAB, is passed to and executed by `LogicManager`,
which calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to instantiate a `AttendanceCommandParser`.
2. The `AttendanceCommandParser#parse` will return a `AttendanceCommand`, provided the user input is valid.
3. `LogicManager` will then call the `Command#execute` method of `AttendanceCommand`.
4. The internals of `AttendanceCommand` creates a new `Student` with the updated `attendance`.
5. A `Person` object is created with the `Student` object as `position`, and replaces the `Person` to be edited in the `AddressBook`.
through the `Model#setPerson` method.
5. Upon successful execution of the command, a message will be displayed to the user, by returning a `CommandResult `
   to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the command to add attendance works:

![AddAttendanceSequenceDiagram](images/AddAttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

### Adding assignments to all students

The addition of assignments in TAB is facilitated by `AddAssignmentsCommand` and `AddAssignmentsCommandParser`.

This feature allows assignments with weightages to be added to each `Student` in TAB. Weightages are separated from the assignment name with the prefix: `w/`

#### Implementation

The `AddAssignmentsCommandParser` parses the user input to check the validity of the Assignment. Then, every `Student` currently listed in TAB will be assigned these Assignments. This is done with the help of the following methods:

* `Student#addAssignment` Adds a single Assignment into the `ArrayList<Assignment>`
* `Student#setAssignments` Adds every Assignment in the user input into `ArrayList<Assignment>`

Listed below are the possible scenarios as well as the behavior of the feature in each scenario.

Scenario 1: User inputs assignments with weightage that does not add up to 100%

e.g. `assignments assignments/ Assignment 1 w/50, Finals w/40`

It will be detected that the weightage of the assignments does not add up to 100 and a `CommandException` is thrown

Scenario 2: User inputs assignments with negative weightage

e.g. `assignments assignments/ Assignment 1 w/-50, Midterms w/50, Finals w/100`

It will be detected that a particular assignment has a negative weightage and a `CommandException` is thrown

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Add Assignments mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `TAB` will initially display all Persons

![AddAssignmentsDiagram1](images/AddAssignmentsDiagram1.png)

Step 2. The user executes `assignments assignments/ Assignment 1 w/15, Assignment 2 w/15, Midterms w/20, Finals w/50`. The `assignments` keyword
causes `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to call `AddAssignmentsCommandParser#parse()`. This returns a `AddAssignmentsCommand`

Step 3. The internals of `AddAssignmentCommand` loops through all the people in the list, checking if they have the position of student

![AddAssignmentsDiagram2](images/AddAssignmentsDiagram2.png)

Step 4. `Assignment` objects will be created according to the user input and added to the `assignmentsList` field in `Student`

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddAssignments operation works:

![AddAssignmentsDiagram3](images/AddAssignmentsDiagram3.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens in AddressBookParser when a user executes a AddAssignment command:

![AddAssignmentsDiagram4](images/AddAssignmentsDiagram4.png)

Design considerations:

Aspect: How AddAssignments executes:
* Alternative 1: Only adds assignments to indexed student
    * Pros: Each student can have different assignments
    * Cons: Will be tedious when there is a large number of students in `TAB`
* Alternative 2: Save Assignments in a json file to be read so every student added after will be automatically instanciated with those assignments
    * Pros: Eliminates the need to run AddAssignments command for new students
    * Cons: Difficulty in implementation

### Adding the grade of a student

#### Implementation

The proposed add grade feature is facilitated by `GradeCommand` which extends `Command` with an index of the student, an index of the assignment, and a grade to be stored.
It overwrites the following operations:
* `GradeCommand#execute()` - Executes the command, storing the given grade of an assignment of a specified student.
* `GradeCommand#equals(Object o)` - Checks if two objects are equal.

A `GradeCommandParser` facilitates the parsing of the user input. It implements `Parser<GradeCommand>.`

After the command is parsed, the given grade is stored inside the `Assignment` of the specified `Student`. This is done with the help of the following methods:
* `Student#updateOverallGrade(Index indexOfAssignment, Sting Grade)` - Calls `setAssignmentGrade()` with the given index and grade, and update the overall grade of the `Student`.
* `Student#setAssignmentGrade(Index indexOfAssignment, String grade)` - Checks whether the index of the assignment is valid. If so, calls `setGrade()` of the corresponding `Assignment` with the given grade.
* `Assignment#setGrade(String grade)` - Stores the given grade inside the `Assignment`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add grade feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will initially display all Persons with their `Positions`.

![AddGradeDiagram0](images/AddGradeDiagram0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `grade 1 assignment/1 grade/86/100`. The `grade` keyword causes `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to call `GradeCommandParser#parse()`. This returns a `GradeCommand`.

![AddGradeDiagram1](images/AddGradeDiagram1.png)

Step 3. The grade of the specified `Assignment` is added.

![AddGradeDiagram2](images/AddGradeDiagram2.png)

Step 4. The internals of `GradeCommand` creates a new `Student` with the updated `overallGrade` and `assignmentList`.

Step 5. A `Person` object is created with the `Student` object as `position`, and replaces the `Person` to be edited in the `AddressBook`.

Step 6. The `AddressBook` displays the updated list of `Person`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add grade operation works:

![AddGradeSequenceDiagram](images/AddGradeSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Student#updateOverallGrade()` calls `Student#setAssignmentGrade()` and returns the updated overall grade of the student
    * Pros: The updated `overallGrade` can be easily used to create the new `Student` object.
    * Cons: Can be confusing as in whether the `assignmentsList` of the `Student` is updated as well.
* **Alternative 2:** `Student#updateOverallGrade()` does not return a value and only handle the calculation of the overall grade with the updated `assignmentsList` provided
    * Pros: Separates the operations done on the `overallGrade` and the `assignmentsList`.
    * Cons: The updated `overallGrade` and `assignmentsList` are not available for creating new `Student` object.

### Editing the availability of a TA

The addition of availability of a `TeachingAssistant` in TAB is facilitated by `AvailabilityCommand` and `AvailabilityCommandParser`.

#### Implementation

1. The user input to add the availability of a TA in TAB, is passed to and executed by `LogicManager`,
   which calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to instantiate a `AvailabilityCommandParser`.
2. The `AvailabilityCommandParser#parse` will return a `AvailabilityCommand`, provided the user input is valid.
3. `LogicManager` will then call the `Command#execute` method of `AvailabilityCommand`.
4. The internals of `AvailabilityCommand` creates a new `TeachingAssistant` with the updated `availability`.
5. A `Person` object is created with the `Student` object as `position`, and replaces the `Person` to be edited in the `AddressBook`.
   through the `Model#setPerson` method.
5. Upon successful execution of the command, a message will be displayed to the user, by returning a `CommandResult `
   to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the command to add availability works:

![AddAvailabilitySequenceDiagram](images/AddAvailabilitySequenceDiagram.png)

### Editing the roles of a Professor

The addition of roles of a `Professor` in TAB is facilitated by `RolesCommand` and `RolesCommandParser`.

#### Implementation

1. The user input to add the availability of a TA in TAB, is passed to and executed by `LogicManager`,
   which calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand` to instantiate a `RolesCommandParser`.
2. The `RolesCommandParser#parse` will return a `RolesCommand`, provided the user input is valid.
3. `LogicManager` will then call the `Command#execute` method of `RolesCommand`.
4. The internals of `RolesCommand` creates a new `Professor` with the updated `role`.
5. A `Person` object is created with the `Professor` object as `position`, and replaces the `Person` to be edited in the `AddressBook`.
   through the `Model#setPerson` method.
5. Upon successful execution of the command, a message will be displayed to the user, by returning a `CommandResult `
   to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how the command to add roles works:

![AddRolesSequenceDiagram](images/AddRolesSequenceDiagram.png)

### Filter by tutorial group

#### Implementation

The filtering feature is facilitated by `FilterCommand`. It extends `Command` with a checking predicate, stored internally as a `TagContainsKeywordPredicate`. It overwrites the following operations:

* `FilterCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the command, filtering the list of people according to whether they have a matching tag.
* `FilterCommand#equals(Object o)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks if two objects are equal.

Given below is a Class Diagram of this feature.

![FilterDiagram1](images/FilterDiagram1.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filtering mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will initially display all Persons.

![FilterDiagram2](images/FilterDiagram2.png)

Step 2. The user executes `filter CS2103-T17` command to filter people that have the `CS2103-T17 tag`. The `filter` keyword causes `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to call `FilterCommandParser#parse()`. This creates a `TagContainsKeywordPredicate` with the keyword `CS2103-T17`, and returns a `FilterCommand` containing this predicate.

![FilterDiagram3](images/FilterDiagram3.png)

Step 3. `Model` then loops through all people in the list, checking if they have a `CS2103-T17` tag.

![FilterDiagram4](images/FilterDiagram4.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the filter command fails its execution, this step will not be reached. A Message will be displayed, letting the reader know how the filter command should be used.

</div>

Step 4. The filtered list will then be displayed to the user.

![FilterDiagram5](images/FilterDiagram5.png)



The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

![FilterDiagram6](images/FilterDiagram6.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. `AddressBook` removes the filter, showing all persons.

![FilterDiagram2](images/FilterDiagram2.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens in AddressBookParser when a user executes a filter command:

<img src="images/FilterDiagram7.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How filter executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Updates the displayed list by hiding information.
    * Pros: Uses less memory
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Creates a new Address Book.
    * Pros: Does not modify the master address book.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

### Display details of contacts in secondary panel

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by `ShowCommand`, which extends `Command` with an index, stored internally as `index`.
It overwrites the following operations:
* `ShowCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the command, displaying the details of the contact at the specified index.
* `ShowCommand#equals(Object o)`â€‰â€”â€‰Checks if two objects are equal.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the displaying mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will initially display all Persons with their `Positions`.

![ShowDiagram1](images/ShowDiagram1.png)

Step 2. The user executes `show 1` command to display the details of the first contact shown. The `show` keyowrd causes
`AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` to call `ShowCommandParser#parse()`. This returns a `ShowCommand` containing the
`index 1`.

![ShowDiagram2](images/ShowDiagram2.png)

Step 3. `Model` retrieves the `Person` object located at `index 1`. This returns a `CommandResult` containing the `Person`
object.

![ShowDiagram3](images/ShowDiagram3.png)

Step 4. `MainWindow` from `UI` component will process the `CommandResult` and display the details found inside the
included `Person` object.

The following show diagram shows how the show operation works:

![ShowSequenceDiagram](images/ShowSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Passing `Person` object to `MainWindow`
    * Pros: Reduced coupling throughout the program
    * Cons: Changing of many method signatures, unintuitive to implement at first.

* **Alternative 2:** Passing `index` to `MainWindow` to retrieve details from `Model`
    * Pros: More intuitive to implement in the sense that only `MainWindow` would be primarily modified.
    * Cons: Increased coupling, violation of Law of Demeter.

### Multiple Teacherâ€™s Address Books (TABs)
**Feature Summary**
- Users are able to create multiple TABs (currently limited to 5).
  - Through `new` command
- Users are able to swap between the TABs
  - Through `swap` command

**Implementation**

Current implementation consists of two parts. First part is creating new books, second part is swapping between books.

**Creating new Books**

This feature builds on `MainWindow` class to facilitate communication between the UI and backend functions. It
communicates with `Logic` to create new TABs and uses `Model` class to alter the current `UserPref` instance.

**Swapping between Books**

This feature, similar to creating new TABs builds on `MainWindow` class and communicates with `Logic` class to swap
between TABs. It uses `Model` class to fetch the next TAB from `UserPref`. The TABs' information are stored as an
array under `preferences.json` as well as the current TAB's index. `UserPref` loops around the array when it reaches
the end. `Logic` then make use of the path information to call `storage` to update the current TAB.

**Example**
Given below is an example usage scenario and how the creation of new TAB mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: User enters the `new` command into the Command-Line Interface (CLI) or user navigates via `Files -> New Book` to
create a new TAB.

The following sequence diagram shows how creation of new book work:
![Creating New Book](images/CreateNewBookSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1.1: User adds X amount of TABs (up to 5):

![Swapping Books](images/CreatingNewBookState0.png)

![Swapping Books](images/CreatingNewBookState1.png)

Step 2: User enters the `swap` command or navigates via `Files -> New Book` to toggle between TABs:

![Swapping Books](images/SwapState0.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how swapping works:
NOTE: Sequence Diagram Only includes added portions
![Swapping Books](images/SwapBooksSequenceDiagram.png)

**Design Considerations**

- Alternative 1 (current choice): Toggle between books
  - Pros:
    - Swapping between TAB occurs within 1 window
    - Open for future features
  - Cons:
    - Might be more prone to bugs due to complex implementations
    - Might be slower to load between books
- Alternative 2: Multiple copies of .java applications
  - Pros
    - Easier to implement
    - Can have multiple books open at once
  - Cons:
    - User need to create multiple books
    - Less open to future feature extensions (communicate between books)

## **Appendix: Effort**

Our team discussed extensively the features we want to include in this tP. Having former TAs in our group, we seeded out problems and issues TAs might face so we would produce a product they would need and want.

One of the biggest problems we faced was how to neatly list the persons in TAB to only show what needs to be seen. We solved this by implementing one of our biggest features: the New feature, which allows users to create new addressbooks so that each addressbook can be used to store students from each module. Swapping and editing each addressbook is also fast and easy

Another one of our big features is our Assignments feature. This feature enabled users to add Assignments to each student, grade each of them individually, and view these statistics on graphs. This entire feature took weeks and a lot of group effort to complete and is one of our proudest features.

In all, our team has placed a large amount of effort to craft this specific product made for teachers and through the weeks we have learnt a lot about teamwork and software engineering practises.
