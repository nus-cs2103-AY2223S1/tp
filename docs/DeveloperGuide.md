### Architecture

<img class="center" src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

#### Main components of the architecture

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


#### Interaction between the architecture components

The ***Sequence Diagram*** below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img class="center" src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above):

* Defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* Implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img class="center" src="images/ComponentManagers.png" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component:

* Executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* Listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* Keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`, `ModuleClass` and `Session` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img class="center" src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TaAssistParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img class="center" src="images/ParserClasses.png"/>

How the parsing works: <a name="parsing"></a>
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TaAssistParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TaAssistParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

The following sequence diagram shows how a generic command `XYZCommand` is parsed from user input with the help of `XYZCommandParser`.

<img class="center" src="images/XYZCommandParserSequenceDiagram.png"/>


### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/model/Model.java)

<img class="center" src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `Model` component:

* Stores data in TA-Assist:
  * All `Student` objects are contained in a `UniqueList` object.
  * All `ModuleClass` objects are also contained in a `UniqueList` object.
* Stores the currently 'selected' `StudentView` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<StudentView>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* The `StudentView` object is a class that encapsulates `Student` data along with a `SessionData` to be displayed to `UI`. More details regarding this class can be referred to in [the Implementation section](#querying-student-grades-for-a-session).
* Stores the currently 'focused' `ModuleClass` object.
* Stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (i.e. `Ui`, `Logic` and `Storage`) as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components.

#### UniqueList

The `UniqueList` class is a generic class that stores a collection of unique elements. In TA-Assist, a `UniqueList` stores either all the `Student` objects or all the `ModuleClass` objects.

<img class="center" src="images/TaAssistObjectDiagram.png"/>

#### ModuleClass, Student, and related classes 

Each `ModuleClass` object stored in `Model` contains a list of `Session` objects that are associated with the `ModuleClass`. 

In order to store module related data, each `Student` object stores a list of `StudentModuleData` objects. 
Each `StudentModuleData` object contains a `ModuleClass` object and a list of `SessionData` objects. 
The `SessionData` objects contains a `Session` object and a grade associated with the session.

`Student`, `ModuleClass`, `Session`, `StudentModuleData`, and `SessionData` objects implement the `Identity<T>` interface which has a single `isSame(T)` method.  The `isSame(T)` method allows `Identity<T>` objects to define a weaker notion of equality than the `equals` method. More details regarding this can be found in the 
[Implementation section](#identity-a-weaker-notion-of-equality).

The relationship between these classes is shown in the following class diagram:

<img class="center" src="images/StudentAndModuleClassDiagram.png"/>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/taassist/storage/Storage.java)

<img class="center" src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" />

The `Storage` component:
* Can save both TA-Assist data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Inherits from both `TaAssistStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.taassist.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented along with explanations for why certain functions are implemented in such a manner.

### Identity: A weaker notion of equality

Since any modifications to an immutable object in `Model` would require constructing new objects, we'll need a method to identify objects with the same identities, i.e. two `ModuleClass`-s have the same identity if their module codes are equal.

For instance, consider the following hypothetical scenario:

Assume the current state of `TaAssist` is as follows:

<img class="center" src="images/ImpleIdentityObjectDiagram.png" />

Now, let's say the user wants to add a `Quiz2` session to IS1103. However, since `ModuleClass` is immutable, we'll have to construct a new `IS1103` ModuleClass instance instead. Call this new instance `NewIS1103`. Hence, the state of `TaAssist` will now look like the one below:

<img class="center" src="images/ImpleIdentityObjectDiagram2.png" />

Now, notice that `AlexIS1103Data` is no longer referencing the same object. In addition, since their contents are different, we can't check with the `equals` method, as the `equals` method in our codebase should perform a strict equality check, i.e. all contents of the two objects must be equal for `equals` to return `True`. Hence, there's no way to identify whether `IS1103` and `NewIS1103` are *inherently* the same module or not.

To handle this issue, `Session`, `ModuleClass`, and `Student` classes implement the interface `Identity<T>` which contains a method `isSame(T obj)` used to compare whether two objects have equivalent identities, i.e. `ModuleClass`-es have equal identity if their module code are then same.

This `Identity` construct is similar to a `<Key, Value>` pair  in a HashMap implementation, where we use the `Key` to determine the object's identity and `Value` for its satellite values.

### Immutability of Student, ModuleClass, and related classes 

In the implementation of the `Student`, `ModuleClass` and other related classes, it was decided to implement them in an immutable manner. 

This is done mainly for three reasons:
* Java passes its values by-reference, this can cause quite the confusion if objects returned by `Model` are mutated.
* Simplifies loading data from `Storage` as we do not need to ensure contents of data in one object has is referencing the same object as another.
* Reduces the possibility of an unobserved mutation as data in `Model` is commonly observed by `UI` through an `ObservableList`.

As such, if the codebase is to be extended to store additional classes within `Model`, it is recommended to implement them in an immutable manner unless there's good reason not to do so.

### Managing attributes within immutable classes

For each of the immutable classes, each time we modify the attributes of the class, we will construct a new instance of the class.

To streamline the process of constructing new instances, we provide `add*`, `remove*`, `update*` methods in the immutable classes, which will return a new instance of the class with the updated attributes.

For instance, 
* `ModuleClass#addSession(session)` -- constructs a new `ModuleClass` with the provided `Session` added into the session list.
* `ModuleClass#removeSession(session)` -- constructs a new `ModuleClass` with the provided `Session` removed from the session list.
* `Student#addModuleClass(moduleClass)` -- constructs a new `Student` with the provided `ModuleClass` added into the module class list.
* `StudentModuleData#updateGrade(session, grade)` -- constructs a new `StudentModuleData` with the grade of the provided `Session` updated.

In addition, methods such as `addSessions` and `removeSessions` are also provided in `Model` and
`TaAssist` to help manage sessions within a class.

For example, the following sequence diagram shows how the command `adds s/Lab1` creates a `Session` named "Lab1" and adds it inside the focused class.

<img class="center" src="images/AddsCommandSequenceDiagram.png"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The above diagram assumes that `Model` is currently in focus mode and 
the focused class doesn't contain a session named `Lab1` as of current.
</div>

### Creating and deleting module classes

Module class information is stored as `ModuleClass` objects, which captures the name of the module class as well as the sessions created for the module class. When the user creates a module class, the program creates a new `ModuleClass` object with the module class name and adds it to the collection of `ModuleClass` objects previously created, which is managed by the `TaAssist` class.

When deleting module classes, all students previously assigned to those module classes will have the module classes unassigned from them, before the `ModuleClass` objects corresponding to those module classes are removed from the collection captured by `TaAssist`.

The following methods in `TaAssist` manages the adding and deleting of module classes from the collection:

* `TaAssist#addModuleClass(ModuleClass moduleClass)` - Adds the provided module class to the list of module classes created.
* `TaAssist#removeModuleClass(ModuleClass moduleClass)` - Removes the provided module class from the list of module classes created.


### Saving and Loading of StudentModuleData and SessionData
When saving the data, we export all the `Students` and `ModuleClass` objects into two JSON arrays in a JSON file. The `ModuleClass` objects and their corresponding `Session` objects are saved in `moduleClasses` array, while the `Student` objects and their corresponding `StudentModuleData`, and `SessionData` objects are saved in the `students` array.

Each `StudentModuleData` and `SessionData` contains a reference to `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects respectively. But the way we saved the data, the actual `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects are in the `moduleClasses` array, while the `StudentModuleData` and `SessionData` need to be in the `students` array and have a way to reference the `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects. 

To solve this problem, we only save the `ModuleClass` name for a `StudentModuleData` ignoring the list of
`Sessions` in the `ModuleClass` object. Similarly, for `SessionData`, we only save the `Session` name ignoring the `Date`.
In code level, we reference the actual `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects from `Model` when required. 

For example, a `Student` object might be saved in `students` array as follows (ignoring some identity fields): 
```json
 {
  "name" : "Alex Yeoh",
  "moduleData" : [ {
    "module" : "CS1231S",
    "data" : [ {
      "session" : "Assignment 1",
      "grade" : 100.0
    } ]
  } ]
}
```
While the `ModuleClass` object for the module "CS1231S" might be saved in `moduleClasses` array as follows:
```json
{
  "name" : "CS1231S",
  "sessions" : [ {
    "name" : "Assignment 1",
    "date" : "2020-09-01"
  } ]
}
```

#### Design considerations
* **Option 1 (Current Choice)**: The `StudentModuleData` and `SessionData` objects only save the `ModuleClass` name and `Session` name respectively. Because in any of their functionality, we do not need to know the list of `Sessions` in the `ModuleClass` object or the `Date` of the `Session` object. 
  * **Pros**:
    * The `StudentModuleData` and `SessionData` objects are independent of the `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects stored in `Model`. 
    * It makes testing easier due to the independence of the `StudentModuleData` and `SessionData` objects.
    * It makes loading of data easier, since we can add a `ModuleClass` or `Session` object with only the name when loading `StudentModuleData` and `SessionData` objects. 
    * According to our JSON format, it is more intuitive to let the `StudentModuleData` and `SessionData` classes only know about the names. 
  * **Cons**: The `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects are duplicated, which may cause confusion when we may need to iterate on the session list in the `ModuleClass` object, for example. So we need to remember that the actual `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects are stored in `Model` and not in the `StudentModuleData` and `SessionData` objects.
  
* **Option 2**: Same as option 1, but we save the names of `ModuleClass` and `Session` as a `String`. 
  * **Pros**: Makes the intention more clear that only the names are required in these classes. 
  * **Cons**: We lose some functionality of the `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects, such as `isSame`, `toString` and other methods. In this approach, we would need to recreate them for `String` instead. 
  
* **Option 3**: While loading the data, we first load `ModuleClass` objects and `Student` objects into two separate lists. Then for each `Student` object and each `StudentModuleData` object, we iterate through the list of `ModuleClass` objects and reference the correct `ModuleClass` object. Then for each of the `SessionData` in the `StudentModuleData` object, we iterate through the list of `Sessions` in the `ModuleClass` object and reference the correct `Session` object.
  * **Pros**: The `ModuleClass` and `Session` objects are not duplicated. The same object is referenced by both the `Model` and `StudentModuleData` or `SessionData` objects.
  * **Cons**: 
    * Implementation of this loading mechanism would be quite convoluted and hard to test. 
    * Maintaining this strong coupling can be quite challenging. 
    * It makes testing more difficult as we need to ensure that the `Model` and `StudentModuleData` or `SessionData` objects are referencing the same object.

### Assigning students to module classes
Each student object contains a collection of `StudentModuleData` where module classes and the grades the student obtained for the sessions of the module classes are stored. When the user assigns students to a module class, a new `StudentModuleData` object is created and added to the collection for each student. 
<img class="center" src="images/AssignCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

Given below are the different steps taken when the user assigns students to a module class.

**Step 1**: The user input is [parsed similar to other commands](#parsing) and an `AssignCommand` object is created using the given the student indices and the module class to assign them to.

**Step 2**: The `AssignCommand` object is executed. The student indices are used to retrieve the `Student` objects from the list of students captured by the `Model`. For each student, steps 3 and 4 are repeated. 

**Step 3**: The `Student#addModuleClass` method is used to create a new `Student` object from the old `Student` object. The method returns the old `Student` if the student is already assigned to the module class. Otherwise, a new `Student` object is created from the old one by copying over all the data fields. Then a new instance of `StudentModuleData` is created with the given `ModuleClass` without any session information and added to the list of `StudentModuleData` of the new `Student` object. The new `Student` object is returned.

**Step 4**: The `Model#setStudent` method is used to replace the old `Student` object with the updated one in the model. 

**Step 5**: The execution ends and returns a `CommandResult` object containing the success message to be displayed by the GUI to the user.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The sequence diagram above doesn't show the case where the student is already assigned to the module class.
</div>

#### Design considerations:

* **Option 1 (Current Choice)**: Let each student maintain a collection of module classes that the student is being assigned to.
  * **Pros**: Only captures necessary information, and easier to implement. This structure is also easier to capture session information for the students.
  * **Cons**: Will be creating multiple `StudentModuleData` objects for a module class when multiple students are assigned to the module class. This may cause performance issues from the large number of objects created.
  
* **Option 2**: Create a matrix of students and classes to determine which module class is assigned to which student.
  * **Pros**: Will allow fast query to whether a student is assigned to a module class, or when looking for all the students assigned to a certain module class.
  * **Cons**: Can possibly be storing a lot of unnecessary information. Considering the target audience of TAs, it is very unlikely for them to be teaching the same student for multiple module classes.

### Unassigning students from module classes

The implementation of unassigning students from module classes is similar to how module classes are assigned to students. The difference is that in the unassigning process, the `StudentModuleData` of the mentioned module classes are removed from the collection of `StudentModuleData` maintained by the students instead.

Refer to [Assigning students to module classes](#assigning-students-to-module-classes) for more information.

### Grading a student for a session
Giving grades for a session is only possible when a `ModuleClass` is focused. It requires updating the student's list of
`StudentModuleData`, where the matching `StudentModuleData` with the current focused `ModuleClass` is updated to reflect the given grade.

<img class="center" src="images/GradeCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

Given bellow are the steps taken when the user gives grade to a student for a session: 

**Step 1**: The user input is [parsed similar to other commands](#parsing) and a `GradeCommand` object is created using the given student indices, session name, and grade. 

**Step 2**: The `GradeCommand` object is executed. The given indices are used to retrieve the `Student` objects from the current curated list of students in `Model`. For each student, steps 3 to 5 are repeated.

<img class="center" src="images/StudentGradeUpdate.png" />

**Step 3**: The old `Student` object is used to create an updated `Student` object via the `Student#updateGrade` method. The method creates the new student with an updated list of `StudentModuleData` by going through the list of the old `Student` object's list of `StudentModuleData` and updating the `StudentModuleData` that matches the current focused `ModuleClass`.

**Step 4**: The `StudentModuleData#updateGrade` method is used to create a new `StudentModuleData` object with the updated grade for the session. The method first creates a new `StudentModuleData` object which has the same list of `SessionData` except the one matching with the given session (if any). The method then creates a new `SessionData` object with the given grade and adds it to the list of `SessionData` in the new `StudentModuleData` object. 

**Step 5**: After finishing steps 3-4, the `GradeCommand` will have an updated student. Then the `Model#setStudent` method is used to replace the old `Student` object with the updated one in the model. 

**Step 6**: The execution ends and returns a `CommandResult` object containing the success message to be displayed by the GUI to the user. 

### Viewing session-wise grades of a student in a class
Viewing session-wise grades of a student is only possible when a `ModuleClass` is in focus. It requires going through the list of `StudentModuleData` of the `Student` object and finding the data for the matching focused class. After retrieving it, the session-wise grade can be read from the list of `SessionData` stored inside the `StudentModuleData`.  

<img class="center" src="images/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

Given bellow are the steps taken when the user wants to view a student's session-wise grades:

**Step 1**: The user input is [parsed similar to other commands](#parsing) and a `ViewCommand` object is created using the given student index. 

**Step 2**: The `ViewCommand` object is executed. The given index is used to retrieve the correct `Student` object from the curated list of students in `Model`.

**Step 3**: The `StudentModuleData` of the student that matches with the current focus class is retrieved using the `Student#findStudentModuleData` method. This method achieves that by searching the `UniqueList` with a new `StudentModuleData` that has the identity of the current focus class. This `StudentModuleData` is guaranteed to exist, since the program is in focus mode. 

**Step 4**: The list of `SessionData` is retrieved from the `StudentModuleData` using the `StudentModuleData#getSessionDataList` method.

**Step 5**: A response message is constructed from the list of `SessionData`, containing all the session-wise grades of the student. 

**Step 6**: The execution ends and returns a `CommandResult` object containing the constructed response to be displayed by GUI to the user. 

### Tracking the state of focus mode

The state of focus mode is tracked by `ModelManager`, which stores the current focused `ModuleClass` (`focusedClass`, as seen in the [class diagram for `Model`](#model-component)). When `focusedClass` is `null`, it indicates that focus mode is inactive. `ModelManager` returns the state of the focus mode via the following methods:
* `ModelManager#isInFocusMode()` - Checks whether focus mode is active.
* `ModelManager#getFocusedClass()` - Returns the current `ModuleClass` in focus.

The following methods in `ModelManager` toggles the state of the focus mode:
* `ModelManager#enterFocusMode(ModuleClass classToFocus)` - Sets focus mode to be active.
  * This is achieved by setting `focusedClass` to be a non-null `ModuleClass` object.
  * This method assumes that `focusedClass` is an existing `ModuleClass` in `TaAssist`.

* `ModuleClass#exitFocusMode()` - Sets focus mode to be inactive.
  * This is achieved by setting `focusedClass` to be `null`.

The above methods are also exposed to the `Model` interface.

The `Logic` component calls these methods in `Model` to execute commands that require access to the state of the focus mode.

For example, the following sequence diagram shows how the `focus` command activates focus mode:

<img class="center" src="images/FocusCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

On the other hand, the `unfocus` command deactivates focus mode by setting `focusedClass` to `null`.

### Querying student grades for a session

This feature allows the user to query student grades of a session to `TaAssist`. `TaAssist` will provide a response showing the grades of all students of the queried session.

Its implementation is facilitated by two classes:

#### StudentView class
`StudentView` encapsulates the view of a `Student` for the UI. It stores the `Student` data itself along with a `SessionData` if queried.

`SessionData` can be queried from a `Student` through the `StudentView::withSession` method. This will construct a new `StudentView` that encapsulates the queried `SessionData`.

This encapsulated `SessionData` internally represented with three values:
* `null`: `SessionData` has not been queried
* An empty `Optional`: `SessionData` has been queried, but doesn't exist in `Student`.
* An `Optional` encapsulating a `SessionData`: `SessionData` has been queried and does exist in `Student`.

#### MappedStudentViewList class
`MappedStudentViewList` maps an `ObservableList<Student>` to an `ObservableList<StudentView>`. 

It takes in `ObservableList<Student>` as a source list. Each `Student` in the source list will be mapped to a `StudentView`. 

It stores two additional parameters, a `ModuleClass` and a `Session`. These parameters are used in determining which `SessionData` to be queried from `Student` and encapsulated by the resulting `StudentView`. 
If either of these two parameters are `null`, `MappedStudentViewList` will assume no `Session` is being queried and the resulting `StudentView` will follow suit.

If the source list is modified, `MappedStudentViewList` will also map the new `Student` data accordingly and execute a `fireChange` to inform its listeners of a new update. 

If the two parameters are modified through the `MappedStudentViewList::setTarget` method, `MappedStudentViewList` will re-map all `Student` to the appropriate `StudentView`-s and execute a `fireChange` to inform its listeners of a new update.

With these two classes implemented, `SessionData` can now be easily passed to `UI` by simply passing the `MappedStudentViewList` within `ModelManager` to `UI`. `UI` will then update accordingly whenever the `MappedStudentViewList` fires a change.

The following sequence diagram shows how changes are propagated to the `UI` through the chain of `ObservableList`-s when `TaAssist::addStudent(s)` is called:

:information_source: **Note:** The diagram above simplifies the `ListView` interaction as it is abstracted away by JavaFX and its details are mostly irrelevant to our implementation.
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How query data is passed to `UI`:**
* **Option 1 (Current Choice)**: Pair `Student` and `SessionData` together in a `StudentView` class.
  * **Pros**: With `Observable` pattern, can be made to automatically update when a new student is graded. Simplifies `UI` implementation.
  * **Cons**: Complicates design of `Model` as it adds another class just for handling the "view" of a student.
* **Option 2**: Maintain two `ObservableList`-s for `Student` and `SessionData` seperately.
  * **Pros**: Reduces the need of a encapsulating class, which simplifies the design of `Model`.
  * **Cons**: Hard to maintain. Accidental slip-up in updating one list but not the other can occur.
* **Option 3**: Let UI query the data from `Student`
  * **Pros**: `Model` needs no change.
  * **Cons**: Breaks abstraction principle. Non-trivial querying of fields from `Student` should be handled by `Model`.
* **Option 4**: Pass data through `CommandResult`
  * **Pros**: Easy to implement.
  * **Cons**: Hard to maintain. Each `Command` now needs to know that `CommandResult` can pass data other than for result display.

### Exporting data as CSV file
This feature allows the user to extract data efficiently from TA-Assist to be used for other purposes such as statistical analysis or result collation on other platforms. Unlike other commands which only works on the `Model`, the `export` command requires access to `Storage` to create a new CSV file and write data to it. This is facilitated by the `ExportCsvStorageAction` class, which is a children of the `StorageAction` class, where further action onto the `Storage` component is processed.

The `CommandResult` class can contain just the feedback to the user, or it can also contain either a `UiAction` or `StorageAction`. These two classes represent an action to be performed by the `Ui` and `Storage` respectively.

The `ExportCsvStorageAction` class is a `StorageAction` that requests the `Storage` to export a CSV file.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `export` command exports a CSV file with the help of `Storage`:

<img class="center" src="images/ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How commands should access the `Storage` class:**
* **Option 1 (Current Choice).** Create a new class of objects `StorageActions` to act on the `Storage` class.
  * **Pros**: Most commands that does not require access to `Storage` will have `Storage` hidden from them. Also, having a class `StorageActions` will allow future features updates such as exporting to Excel files be easier to implement.
  * **Cons**: Unable to have commands that act on `Storage` first before acting on `Model`.
* **Option 2.** Let all commands execute with access to both `Model` and `Storage`.
  * **Pros**: Allows the program to have commands that act on `Storage` and `Model` in any order.
  * **Cons**: Unnecessary exposure of `Storage` to other commands that does not require access to it. In our case, this is the majority of the commands.

### UI Implementation
#### Home Screen

<img class="center" src="images/UiMainScreen.png" />

The main screen consists of the following components:
* `ResultDisplay` shows the results produced by the command input from the user; 
* `ModuleClassListPanel` shows a list of module classes, each `ModuleClassCard` represents a module class, arranged in alphabetical order;
* `StudentListPanel` shows a list of student, each `StudentCard` represents a student, arranged in alphabetical order;
* `CommandBox`, the Command Line Interface (CLI) for user to key in command and
* `HelpWindow` shown with a help button, redirect users to our User Guide to facilitate their usage;

It was designed with the following considerations:
* Users have class-oriented focus while using this application. Their actions such as grading/assigning students to a class or initiating sessions revolve around a particular class, therefore we find it suitable to put the classes users have added within the `MainWindow`.
* Operations on students can be performed conveniently by showing the list of all students on the main window, such as deleting, adding and finding students whenever required.
* As we are targeting users with higher preference on CLI than GUI, putting the command input box at the bottom of the window may be more instinctive for their usage, due to the high similarity with the implementation of command terminals from various operating systems.

#### Focus Mode

<img class="center" src="images/UiFocusScreen.png" />

The screen upon entering the focus mode consists of components:
* `ResultDisplay`, as aforementioned, shows the results produced by the command input from the user;
* `SessionListPanel` shows a list of sessions, with each `SessionCard` representing a session, sorted based on the most recently added date;
* `StudentListPanel`, similar to the main screen, shows a list of student, with each `StudentCard` representing a student, arranged in alphabetical order;
* `CommandBox`, the Command Line Interface (CLI) for user to key in command and
* `HelpWindow` shown with a help button that redirects users to our User Guide to facilitate their usage; a back button that allow user to leave the focus mode; and a header which shows the class the user is currently focused in.

Whenever users call `scores s/SESSION_NAME`, the grade pertaining to that particular session appear, with ungraded students highlighted in red to the users.

<img class="center" src="images/UiGrading.png" />

It was designed with the following consideration:
* As sessions are usually time-sensitive, with those added later often being the more relevant sessions, sorting the sessions with the newest session at the front facilitate users in finding the sessions they are concerned with recently.
