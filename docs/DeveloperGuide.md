### **Setting up, getting started**

Refer to the guide 
[_Setting up and getting started_](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/docs/SettingUp.md).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Introduction**

NUSEatWhere is a Command Line (CLI) application which helps you search for the available food options in NUS and 
make an informed decision on where to eat. It does this via a preloaded set of data paired with commands that helps the
user navigate the list of eateries in the National University of Singapore (NUS).

This Developer Guide aims to outline how the NUSEatWhere application was implemented to ensure
ease of modifications for any future changes/developments you might have in mind for our application.

_For details on commands or how a user would use the application, 
you can refer to our [User Guide](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w11-1.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)._

### Architecture

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" /> <br>
The Architecture Diagram explains the high-level design of the App.
</p>

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called 
[`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/eatwhere/foodguide/Main.java) and 
[`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/eatwhere/foodguide/MainApp.java). 
It is responsible for,

* **At app launch**: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.

* **At shut down**: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" /> <br>
The Sequence Diagram shows how the components interact with each other for the 
scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.
</p>

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<br>

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" /> <br>
The (partial) class diagram shows how the Logic class interacts with the Model and Storage classes.
</p>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality 
using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given 
component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being 
coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram above.

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in 
[`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/eatwhere/foodguide/ui/Ui.java)

<p align="center">
<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png"  /> <br>
The class diagram showing the Ui class.
</p>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `EateryListPanel`, 
`StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures 
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files 
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the 
[`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/eatwhere/foodguide/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* __executes user commands__ using the `Logic` component.
* __listens for changes to `Model` data__ so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* __keeps a reference to the `Logic` component__, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it __displays the `Eatery` object__ residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/eatwhere/foodguide/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<p align="center">
<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/> <br>
The class diagram showing the Logic class.
</p>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FoodGuideParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an eatery).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width = "1000" /> <br>
The Sequence Diagram illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.
</p>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/> <br>
The diagram shows the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command.
</p>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FoodGuideParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `FoodGuideParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/eatwhere/foodguide/model/Model.java)

<p align="center">
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" /> <br>
The class diagram shows the Model class.
</p>

The `Model` component,

* __Stores the address book data__ i.e., all `Eatery` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueEateryList` object).
* __Stores the currently 'selected' `Eatery` objects__ (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Eatery>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* __Stores a `UserPref` object__ that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* Does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FoodGuide`, which `Eatery` references. This allows `FoodGuide` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Eatery` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<p align="center">
<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" /><br>
The diagram shows a more OOP model, the main difference being how Tag is implemented.
</p>

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W11-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/eatwhere/foodguide/storage/Storage.java)

<p align="center">
<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" /><br>
The class diagram shows the Storage class.
</p>

The `Storage` component,

* Can __save both food guide data and user preference data__ in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* Inherits from both `FoodGuideStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* Depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `eatwhere.foodguide.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation Details**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Displaying Command Help

Users are able to view a help or usage message for individual commands by including a special flag in their input.
This mimics the behaviour found in other CLI applications and shells, where it is facilitated by
the addition of arguments such as `-h`, `-help`, or `--help`.

#### Implementation

The FoodGuide's current `PREFIX_HELP`, representing the help flag, is `-h`,
which aligns with the other prefixes in the command syntax.
In the FoodGuide, since all parsing beyond identifying the command word is handled by individual command parsers,
searching for this flag has to be done in these parsers.

Individual `CommandParser`s return instances of their `Command`.
Because different commands have varying number of arguments, modifying `CommandResult` to support the
displaying of a help message would require additional constructors for all supported commands,
which is tedious and makes future commands harder to implement.

Therefore, the option to display help instead makes use of a special exception `DisplayCommandHelpException`,
which is thrown when `PREFIX_HELP` is detected. This then bypasses usual command evaluation and
returns the usage message of the command.

The detection of `PREFIX_HELP` is as follows:
* The prefix must not be accompanied by a value. `-hello` and `-h ello` will not invoke the exception.
* Presence of the prefix overrides other arguments.

The detection rules limit false-positives from stray `-h`s in names of eateries, locations, etc.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/CommandDisplayHelpActivityDiagram.png" width="700" /> <br>
For supported commands, the activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a command.
</p>

### Favourite/Unfavourite feature
The favourite/unfavourite commands were introduced as a way to standardize how "favourite eateries" are tagged.
In a way, `fav`/`unfav` is a shortcut for `tag`/`untag`. The "`<3`" favourite tag is implemented in such a way in the interest of time, and the fact that
it can be searched up with other tags via `findTag`, hence proving to be more useful at the project's current iteration.

#### Implementation
Currently, `FavouriteCommand`/`UnfavouriteCommand` is similar to the other commands available for use, with the exception that it 
_extends_ `TagCommand`/`UntagCommand` and not `Command`. Since `FavouriteCommand` and `UnfavouriteCommand` are both implemented
in a similar way, this section will be focusing mainly on `FavouriteCommand` for ease of explanation.

<p align="center">
<img src="images/FavouriteSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000"/> <br>
The Sequence Diagram shows the interactions within the Logic component when `fav` is called.
</p>

As can be seen by the above diagram, most function calls to `FavouriteCommand` is directed to TagCommand, though there are some points to note:
* The fixed "`<3`" tag should be made into a tag in the `FavouriteCommand` class rather than in the `TagCommand` class. This is because `FavouriteCommand` is the subclass, hence `TagCommand` should have no dependencies on `FavouriteCommand`.
* Using the above-mentioned `-h` help command should show a custom message for `FavouriteCommand`, since it's command `fav` is different from `tag`.
* Upon successfully favouriting an eatery, the user should receive a message indicating the "`<3`" is a tag, and can be searched up and used as a criteria for the `-r` randomizer feature via the `findTag` command.

Through a comparison with the sequence diagram found in the [logic component section](#logic-component) that bears the shape of most of the default commands, it can be seen in exactly which function calls `FavouriteCommand` differs.
<br>

When `FavouriteCommand` is first initialized, it initializes `TagCommand` via a `super()` method call. Hence, the process of turning "`<3`" into a tag acceptable by `TagCommand` has to be streamlined, such that prefixes in `FavouriteCommand` are used.
Additionally, the `execute()` call to `FavouriteCommand` is passed onto `TagCommand` whereby `TagCommand` then normally interacts with the `Model` class as other commands do.

This unique implementation of `FavouriteCommand` and `UnfavouriteCommand` is especially important to keep in mind if future modifications (e.g. keeping favourited eateries at the top of the list) are implemented.

### Optional fields in Eateries _(currently not in use)_
The ability to keep some fields optional is very useful as the user is less inclined to use a dummy input when seeking to decide on the contents on fields later.
Hence, this works with the `edit` command to give the user even more flexibility.
Due to the importance of the `price` field, this option is removed and no longer presented to the user in the current iteration of our product. However, it is still feasible to implement should the need for it arise.

#### Implementation

<p align="center">
<img src="images/OptionalFieldActivityDiagram.png" width="700" /> <br>
The Activity Diagram shows how different the AddCommandParser and Eatery classes operate with different inputs.
</p>

_(Note: This diagram omits references to `-h` help as it is presented on its own. For more information about help, you can refer to the
[section about the -h command](#displaying-command-help) above.)_

As seen from the diagram, the compulsory fields are always checked first to ensure that the argument map does not contain null values.
Thereafter, the call to the optional field's constructor is handled within the `Eatery` object.
The optional field should be able to receive both null and non-null values (or by using 2 different constructors), with the input left empty indicating that there is currently no value for the optional field.
At the end, a complete eatery is returned to be added, with other classes having no idea whether the Eatery contains the optional field or not.
<br>

Since null values may cause NullPointerException errors, it is important that all data relating to this field is kept within the class itself.
Hence, heavy abstraction should be used here. Such examples include:
* Not giving public direct access to the value (e.g. `toString()` returns `" "` instead of null)
* Keeping the parsing of the data files to the related optional field class only
<br>

There are several ways to deal with storing this optional value, but the one that was used for this particular implementation was storing the optional field as an empty `""` string. This is because the optional field constructor with a value did not allow null values. Hence, any empty strings appearing in the json save file must have been due to the use of the default constructor.


### Searching through Food Guide

Users are currently able to search individual fields of eateries in `Food Guide` by the following commands:
* `find`: search by `Name`
* `findLocation`: search by `Location`
* `findCuisine`: search by `Cuisine`
* `findPrice`: search by `Price`
* `findTags`: search by `Tags`

#### Implementation

<p align="center">
<img src="images/FindPriceSequenceDiagram.png" /> <br>
The Sequence diagram *illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("findPrice $")` API call.*
</p>

Augmenting `AB3`'s current implementation of `find`, each `find` command currently has its own `CommandParser` 
which returns its respective `Command`. To execute the command `"findPrice $"`, `FoodGuideParser` creates 
a `FindPriceCommandParser` to parse the user command and create a `findPriceCommand` object. 

In order to keep track of the user's inputted search terms, we utilize `XYZContainsKeywordsPredicate` 
(XYZ is a placeholder for the field being searched, e.g. `LocationContainsKeywordsPredicate`). 
`XYZContainsKeywordsPredicate` implements the Java functional interface `Predicate<Eatery>`, 
taking in an `Eatery` object while containing the user's inputted search terms in the form of a list.

The `Predicate` returns `True` if, for the field being searched, 
ANY of the search terms in said `Predicate`'s list matches the value stored in an eatery's field. 

In particular, the current implementation of `find` and `findLocation`, we perform a case-insensitive substring search. 
For each respective `Predicate` object, it tests `True` if _any_ of the user's inputted search terms 
is a substring of the eatery's stored name or location respectively. For example, given an eatery with the location
`"(Frontier, Air-Con)"`, `LocationContainsKeywordsPredicate` will test `True` for any of (but not limited to) 
the following search terms:
* `"("` and `")"`, 
* `"-"` and `","`,
* `"Front",` `"Frontier,"` and `"air-con"`

Each `XYZContainsKeywordsPredicate` is then used by `ModelManager` to update the current list of displayed eateries.
