## **Introduction**

PayMeLah is a desktop application that helps users track the debts that they are owed. It uses a Command Line Interface (CLI), and executes commands input by the user accordingly to perform actions such as adding a person/debt to track, sorting the data etc.

This Developer Guide documents the architecture, design choices, and implementations of key features of PayMeLah.

If you are a developer that recently joined the PayMeLah development team, or a developer who is simply interested in the inner workings of PayMeLah, this guide would be able to provide you with the relevant technical details.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/paymelah/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/paymelah/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/paymelah/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/paymelah/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/paymelah/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/paymelah/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="900" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
  * each `Person` object separately stores `Debt` objects (contained in a `DebtList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/paymelah/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add debt feature: `adddebt`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by `AddDebtCommand` and `AddDebtCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and work as per [described above](#logic-component).

When given a valid user input, the `AddDebtCommandParser` will create a new `Debt` object to add to the `DebtList` of the specified `Person`.

Consider a scenario where the user wishes to add a $10 food debt to multiple people. To speed up adding similar `Debt` objects to the `DebtList` of more than 1 `Person`, the `AddDebtCommand` takes in a `Set` of multiple indices. For each `Person` that an `Index` corresponds to, a new `Debt` object will be added to the `DebtList` of the specified `Person`. Some commands such as marking debts as paid, or possible future extensions such as editing a debt, may require modifying a `Debt` object in the `DebtList` of a `Person`. To ensure that modifying this `Debt` for 1 `Person` does not also erroneously modify the `Debt` of another `Person`, during execution of `adddebt`, each `Debt` object is only added to one `DebtList`, and an `equal` instance of `Debt` is created and added for each other `DebtList`.

To enable the user to retroactively add a `Debt` that is backdated, the `AddDebtCommandParser` can take in optional `<date>` and `<time>` parameters. By making these parameters optional, a default behaviour can be implemented such that when neither parameter is specified, a `Debt` object with the current date and time is created. This will improve the efficiency at which users can input new `Debt` objects for the (expected) most common scenario where they add the `Debt` into PayMeLah on the actual day the debt occurred.

<img src="images/AddDebtObjectDiagram.png" width="750" />

Consider an example of a valid `adddebt` command, `adddebt 1 2 d/food m/10`. The new objects in the final internal state after this example has been parsed is given by the object diagram above. Note that new `DebtDate` and `DebtTime` objects are created even though the user did not specify date and time parameters in their input command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagrams detail the behaviour of PayMeLah when a user inputs an `adddebt` command of valid syntax to be executed.

<img src="images/AddDebtActivityDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<img src="images/AddDebtActivityDiagramRake.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Split debt feature: `splitdebt`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by `SplitDebtCommand` and `SplitDebtCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and work as per [described above](#logic-component).

When given a valid user input, the `SplitDebtCommandParser` will create a new `Debt` object to add to the `DebtList` of the multiple specified `Person` objects.
The following implementation is highly similar to the above implementation of [add debt](#add-debt-feature-adddebt), however, it differs in that '0' is a valid position in representing a `Person` to the `SplitDebtCommandParser`, and
the value of the `Money` of the `Debt` added to each `Person` is the amount the command specified divided by the number of specified `Person` objects.
However, '0' is not a valid `Index` internally and is only a placeholder to indicate that the user is included in the number of specified `Person` objects. Thus, no `Debt` is actually added to the `Person` whose position in the
displayed list is '0'. It should also be noted that there is also never such a `Person`. The non-zero `Index` objects of the `Person` objects splitting the `Debt` are contained in a set that `DeleteDebtCommandParser` creates.
The `SplitDebtCommandParser` will construct a `SplitDebtCommand` object with this set of `Index` objects and the `Debt` object created.
The remaining functionality and behaviour of `SplitDebtCommand` and `SplitDebtCommandParser` are identical to that of [add debt](#add-debt-feature-adddebt).

Consider an example of a valid `splitdebt` command, `splitdebt 0 1 2 d/pizza m/30`. The new objects in the final internal state after this example has been parsed is given by the object diagram below. Note that new `DebtDate` and `DebtTime` objects are created even though the user did not specify date and time parameters in their input command.

<img src="images/SplitDebtObjectDiagram.png" width="750" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Clear debts feature: `cleardebts`

#### Implementation
This feature is facilitated by `ClearDebtsCommand` and `ClearDebtsCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and work as per [described above](#logic-component).

When given a valid user input, the `ClearDebtsCommandParser` will construct a `ClearDebtsCommand` object with the parsed `Index` representing the position of the `Person` in the `Model` component to have his/her debts cleared.

Receiving the `Index` of the specified `Person` from the `ClearDebtsCommandParser`, the `ClearDebtsCommand` object obtains the `Person` object specified from the `Model` component when executed.
The `ClearDebtsCommand` object will create a new `Person` object with identical fields from the `Person` object previously obtained except for a new empty `DebtList`.
This new `Person` object replaces the original `Person` object in the `Model` component.

Consider an example of a valid `cleardebts` command `cleardebts 1`. The objects in the internal state after this example has been parsed, and after the constructed `ClearDebtsCommand` has been executed, is given by the object diagrams on the next page.

<img src="images/ClearDebtsObjectDiagram.png" width="450" />
<img src="images/ClearDebtsObjectDiagramAfter.png" width="400" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete debt feature: `deletedebt`

#### Implementation
This feature is facilitated by `DeleteDebtCommand` and `DeleteDebtCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and work as per [described above](#logic-component).

When given a valid user input, the `DeletDebtCommandParser` will create a set with the `Index` object that represents the position of the `Debt` object to be removed from the `DebtList` of the specified `Person`.
The `DeleteDebtCommandParser` will construct a `DeleteDebtCommand` object with this set of `Index` objects and the parsed `Index` representing the position of the `Person` in the `Model` component to have his/her debts cleared.

Consider a scenario where the user wishes to delete multiple debts from a person, such as when multiple debts were added to him/her incorrectly. To speed up deleting multiple `Debt` objects from the `DebtList` of the specified `Person`, the `DeleteDebtCommandParser` can take in multiple indices such that the set with the `Index` object contains multiple `Index` objects that each represent the position of the `Debt` object to be removed.

Receiving this set of `Index` objects, and the `Index` of the specified `Person` from the `DeleteDebtCommandParser`, the `DeleteDebtCommand` object obtains the `Person` object and the `Debt` objects specified by the set from the `Model` component when executed.
The `DeleteDebtCommand` object will create a new `Person` object with identical fields from the `Person` object previously obtained except for a new `DebtList` that does not contain the previously obtained `Debt` objects to be removed.
This new `Person` object replaces the original `Person` object in the `Model` component.

The following sequence diagram details such behaviour of PayMeLah when a user enters `deletedebt 1 debt/2 3` to be executed.

<img src="images/DeleteDebtSequenceDiagram.png" width="1100" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteDebtCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Consider an example of a valid `deletedebt` command `deletedebt 1 debt/2 3`. The new objects in the internal state after this example has been parsed, and after the constructed `DeleteDebtCommand` has been executed, is given by the following object diagrams.

<img src="images/DeleteDebtObjectDiagram.png" width="450" />
<img src="images/DeleteDebtAfterObjectDiagram.png" width="280" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find-by-anything feature: `find`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by `FindCommand` and `FindCommandParser` in the `Logic` component, and works as per [described above](#logic-component).

`FindCommandParser` retrieves all prefixes supported by the command using `ArgumentTokenizer`.
The resulting `ArgumentMultimap` is converted to a `PersonDescriptor`, which will hold the person-related fields to search for,
and a `DebtsDescriptor`, which will hold the debt-related fields to search for, using `ParserUtil`'s `argumentMultimapToPersonDescriptor` and `argumentMultimapToDebtsDescriptor` respectively.
A check ensures that at least one field to search for is specified.
Then, the `PersonDescriptor` and `DebtsDescriptor` are used to construct a `PersonMatchesDescriptorPredicate`,
which will return `true` if the given `Person` matches all the person-related fields in `PersonDescriptor` and all the debt-related fields in `DebtsDescriptor`.

For example, suppose the user has multiple friends named Gary, and wants to find the one that owes money for a burger.
The command `find n/gary d/burger` can be used to accomplish this. The sequence diagram below shows the basic events that take place.

<img src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png" width="1100" />

Note that due to the universal nature of find-by-anything, this command is dependent on lots of components, as given in the following page:

<img src="images/FindClassDiagram.png" width="750" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List debtors feature: `listdebtors`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by `ListDebtorsCommandParser` and `ListDebtorsCommand` in the `Logic` component. It also utilises `DebtGreaterEqualAmountPredicate` which implements Java's in-built `Predicate` interface. The command parser and the command itself work similarly to the others, and will not be explained in detail here. Please refer to the Logic component above for more details.

The `DebtGreaterEqualAmountPredicate` constructor takes in a `Money` object, and returns a `Predicate<Person>` that tests whether a `Person`'s total amount owed is greater than or equal to the `Money` parameter. When a user requests to list debtors who owe over a certain amount of money, `ListDebtorsCommandParser` will create a `DebtGreaterEqualAmountPredicate` using the amount provided. The resulting `ListDebtorsCommand` will use this predicate to communicate to the Model which Persons to display: the ones that pass the predicate's test. Note that this command does not modify the internal list of Persons in the Model, only the displayed list.

As an example, suppose the user requests to list debtors who owe more than $10 using the command `listdebtors m/10`. The sequence diagram below shows the illustrates the events that take place.

<img src="images/ListDebtorsSequence.png" width="1000" />

To cater to a common use case where the user might want to simply list all debtors regardless of the amount they owe, `ListDebtorsCommandParser` can also handle requests without an amount specified. In such a case, it will create a predicate that simply checks whether a Person's DebtList is empty.

The activity diagram below details the behaviour of PayMeLah when a user requests to list debtors. Note the difference in behaviour depending on whether the user specifies an amount.

<img src="images/ListDebtorsActivity.png" width="600" />

* **Alternative for listing all debtors:** use a `DebtGreaterEqualAmountPredicate` with $0.01 as the amount
    * Pros: More consistent behaviour: every `ListDebtorsCommand` will have an associated `DebtGreaterEqualAmountPredicate`.
    * Cons: May not work properly with possible future extensions (e.g. Money modified to use other precisions besides 2 decimal points)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Mark debts as paid/unpaid feature: `mark`/`unmark`

#### Implementation

This feature is facilitated by `MarkCommand`/`UnmarkCommand`, and `MarkCommandParser`/`UnmarkCommandParser` in the `Logic` component. It also utilises `Debt` and `DebtList` in the `Model` component. The command parser and the command itself work similarly to the others, and will not be explained in detail here. Please refer to the Logic component above for more details.

When given a valid user index, the `MarkCommandParser`/`UnmarkCommandParser` will create a new `Debt` object marked as paid/unpaid in the `DebtList` of the specified `Person`.

To speed up marking `Debt` objects as paid (for example, when 1 person has paid for multiple debts in 1 shot) in the `DebtList` of 1 `Person`, the `MarkCommand` can take in multiple indices such that a replaced `Debt` object (only if it is unpaid) will be added to the `DebtList` for each mark operation.

An example of the new objects in the internal state when a valid `mark` command provided by the user, `mark 1 debt/2 3`, has been parsed and then executed is given by the object diagrams below.

<img src="images/MarkObjectDiagram.png" width="450" />
<img src="images/MarkAfterObjectDiagram.png" width="280" />

The following activity diagrams on the next pages detail the behaviour of PayMeLah when a user inputs a `mark` command of valid syntax to be executed.

<img src="images/MarkActivityDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<img src="images/MarkActivityDiagramRake.png" width="450" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Undo feature: `undo`

#### Implementation

This feature is achieved by saving `addressBookHistories` in the `ModelManager` as a `LinkedBlockingDeque`. Before PayMeLah executes a command that modifies its AddressBook, a copy of the AddressBook will be pushed into this double ended queue. This deque also enforces a capacity of 10; when the dequeue is full and another AddressBook is about to be pushed into it, the oldest AddressBook will be discarded.

When the user gives an `undo` command, the most recent AddressBook will be popped from the `addressBookHistories` and replace the current one.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How undo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage (currently mediated by limiting the capacity of `addressBookHistories` to 10).

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

       Expected: The addition of `newPerson2` to `newPerson11` are reverted successfully, but PayMeLah warns that there are no commands to undo when attempting to do so the 11th time.

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

   1. Prerequisites: PayMeLah has been launched at least once and an `addressbook.json` has been created in the `data` folder.
   
   1. Test case: delete the `addressbook.json` and launch PayMeLah<br>
      Expected: PayMeLah launches with the sample persons and debts again, and the corresponding `addressbook.json` has been created in the `data` folder.
   
   1. Test case: open `addressbook.json` and delete a few random lines to corrupt the data. Then launch PayMeLah.<br>
      Expected: PayMeLah launches with an empty list of persons, and `addressbook.json` is cleared to show an empty person list as well.
   
   1. Test case: while PayMeLah is open, delete or modify `addressbook.json`, then execute any valid command in PayMeLah.<br>
      Expected: PayMeLah functions normally and overwrites any corrupted data

## **Appendix: Effort**

* Summary of new features/enhancements compared to AB3:
  * Functional code
    * Introduction of `model.debt` package inclusive of 8 classes, to track debts in addition to persons. Great effort was expanded in integrating the package to existing AB3.
    * Implementation of 11 new `commands` classes (and corresponding `parser` classes) related to managing debts and searching through the person list.
    * Refactoring and enhancement of `find` command to be significantly more comprehensive and effective
    * Updating of GUI
  * Test code
    * Addition of `testutil` classes related to `model.debt` package
    * Significant effort to consistently maintain coverage around the initial 70% from AB3 by always adding new test code with each new feature in the same iteration.
    * Heavy effort in maintaining and passing existing tests to prevent regressions when adding new fields to existing AB3 code and when enhancing code with new fields across iterations.
  * Documentation
    * Greatly expanded UG with more tutorials, examples and explanations for users
    * Increased user-friendliness of UG significantly
    * Maintenance (inclusive of revisions and updates) of existing DG documentation
    * Inclusion of new features and corresponding insights in DG

* Challenges faced:
  * Learning of regex to ensure continuity with AB3 parse format
  * Learning of JavaFX to update GUI
  * Learning of Jackson to maintain data file
  * Learning of PlantUML to update DG
