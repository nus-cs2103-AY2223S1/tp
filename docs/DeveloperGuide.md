## 4. **Design and Implementation**

### 4.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/classify/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/classify/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:
* application launch: Initialises the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* application shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#415-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#411-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#412-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#413-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#414-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete id/123A`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.1 UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/classify/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/classify/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.2 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/classify/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `StudentRecordParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete id/123A")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `StudentRecordParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `StudentRecordParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.3 Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/classify/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component:

* stores the student record data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.4 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T15-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/classify/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both student record data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `StudentRecordStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.1.5 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.classify.commons` package.

### 4.2 Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

#### 4.2.1 AddStudent command

**Description**

Adding new students is first basic step of using Class-ify. This is primarily done via the `AddStudentCommand` and `AddStudentCommandParser` classes.
Before going into the sequence of executing a `addStudent` command, let us take a quick look at the `Student` class.

<img src="images/StudentClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Student` class contains a total of 6 fields:
* 2 `Name` fields for the student and parent names 
* 1 `Id` field 
* 1 `Phone` number field 
* 1 `Email` address field 
* 1 set of `Exam`(s)
    * The type of exams are currently limited to _CA1_, _CA2_, _SA1_ and _SA2_.
    * Future implementations may allow teachers to create their own examinable items.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Implementation**

Adding a student record can be divided into 2 main steps: parsing the user input and executing it.

**Step 1: Parsing the command**

The add student command is first parsed.

1. `MainWindow` calls the `execute` method of `LogicManager` to execute the given userâ€™s command.
2. Before the command is executed, it is parsed by `StudentRecordParser`, which identifies the command to be an `addStudent` command and creates a new `AddStudentCommandParser` instance to parse the userâ€™s command.
3. Once the command is successfully parsed, `AddStudentCommandParser` creates a new `AddStudentCommand` instance which will be executed by the `LogicManager`.

**Step 2: Executing the command**

The `AddStudentCommand` instance now interacts with the `ModelManager` to execute the command.
1. The `hasStudent` method is called to check if the `Model` contains the student to be added.
2. Assuming there are no duplicates, the `addStudent` method is then called to add the student into the student record.
3. The `updateFilteredStudentList` method is called to show the updated list of students in the student record.
4. A new `CommandResult` instance is created and returned to `LogicManager`.
5. The control is then passed back to `MainWindow` where the `CommandResult` is displayed to the UI as feedback to the user.

The following activity diagram below summarizes what happens when a user executes an `addStudent` command.

<img src="images/AddStudentCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

**Design Considerations**

The current approach creates multiple `Class` objects per student. It serves as a more straightforward implementation. However, it is not a very OOP solution for the following reasons:

1. Multiple `Class` objects for the same class.
2. Classes do not have students.
   * A `Class` object has no reference to the students in that class. 

An alternative and perhaps more OOP approach is given below. It has a `Class` list in the `StudentRecord`, which references to `Student`.

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

* `StudentRecord` only requires one `Class` object per unique class the teacher teaches, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Class` objects.
* `Class` has reference to `Student`, modelling the relationship in which a teacher teaches a class with some students.
* Every `Class` has a set of `Exam`(s) which a `Student` takes and scores a certain grade.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.2 Delete command

**Description**

The delete command allows users to delete a student record by targeting either the studentâ€™s name or ID.

**Implementation**

Deleting a student record can be divided into 2 main steps: parsing the command and executing it.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component when the user calls a delete command, for example, `delete id/123A`.

<img src="images/DeleteCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 1: Parsing the command**

The delete command is first parsed.

1. The `execute` method of `LogicManager` is called to execute the userâ€™s command, `delete id/123A`.
2. Before the command is executed, it is parsed by `StudentRecordParser`, which identifies the command to be a delete command and creates a new `DeleteCommandParser` instance to parse the userâ€™s command.
3. Once the command is successfully parsed, `DeleteCommandParser` creates a new `DeleteCommand` instance which will be executed by the `LogicManager`.

**Step 2: Executing the command**

The `DeleteCommand` instance now communicates with the `ModelManager` to execute the command.

1. The `updateFilteredStudentList` method is called to isolate the student record to be deleted.
2. The `deleteStudent` method is called to delete the student record.
3. The `updateFilteredStudentList` method is called again to show all student records.
4. A new `CommandResult` instance is created and returned to `LogicManager`.

**Design Considerations**

- Option 1 (Current design): We chose to keep a single class `DeleteCommand`, which the user can use to delete student records either by targeting the studentâ€™s name or student ID. Note that we chose not to delete student records by their index in the list since deletion is irreversible, and we wanted users to be aware of the exact student name when they are executing a `DeleteCommand`.

  - Pros:
    - The user does not have to remember different types of delete commands such as `DeleteStudentByNameCommand` or `DeleteStudentByIDCommand`.

  - Cons:
    - The parser would have to identify whether the user targeted the studentâ€™s name or student ID to delete the student record.

- Option 2: Split `DeleteCommand` into two different commands, `DeleteStudentByNameCommand` and `DeleteStudentByIDCommand`.

  - Pros:
    - There is no requirement for prefixes such as `nm/` or `id/` to identify whether the user is targeting the studentâ€™s name or student ID.

  - Cons:
    - Additional classes need to be implemented.
    - The command name is long.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.3 Edit command

**Description**

The `EditCommand` updates the student record at a given index. Under the hood, a new `Student` object is created to replace the student to be edited.

**Implementation**

Editing a student record involves 2 main steps:

**Step 1: Parsing the command**

1. After the user inputs the `EditCommand`, the `StudentRecordParser` will identify the command and create a `EditCommandParser` instance in the `LogicManager`.

2. The `EditCommandParser` parses the rest of the user's input and creates a new `EditCommand` object which will be executed by the `LogicManager`.

**Step 2: Executing the command**

The `EditCommand` object now communicates with the `ModelManager` to execute the command.

1. The `createEditedStudent` method is called to create a new `editedStudent` with the edited fields updated.

2. The `editedStudent` replaces the  student to be edited with the `setStudent` method. 

3. The `updateFilteredStudentList` method is called to show all student records.

4. A new `Command Result` instance is created and returned to `LogicManager`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.4 Find command

**Description**

`FindCommand`, which extends `Command`, simulates searching through the `StudentRecord` for particular students. This is implemented through filtering the current list of students according to the user input, and displaying the filtered results to the user.

**Implementation**

`FindCommand` is executed through 2 steps:

**Step 1: Parsing the command**

The user input is first parsed by `StudentRecordParser`, in the same way as other commands. After the input is identified to be a `find` command, a `FindCommandParser` instance will be created to further parse the command arguments.

The `FindCommandParser` searches the input for either `PREFIX_STUDENT_NAME` or `PREFIX_ID` (but not both), and depending on which `Prefix` is present, instantiates a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object or `IdPredicate` object respectively. Both inherit from `Predicate<Student>`.

This `Predicate<Student>` will then be used to create a `FindCommand` object.

**Step 2: Executing the command**

The `FindCommand` object created will then interact with the `ModelManager` to execute the command.

1. Using the `Preicate<Student>` created when parsing the command, `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate<Student>)`
   is called, to filter the list of students.
2. The filtered list is returned to the user, and they will be able to view the list of students whose name contains the
   specified keyword(s), or whose Id matches the specified Id.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Usage scenario**

Given below is an example usage scenario of `FindCommand`.

Step 1. The user launches the application and sees a list of students.

Step 2. The user executes `find nm/Alex` to locate students with "Alex" in their name.
This command performs a search using the names of the students. Since the prefix `nm/` was used, a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` object, which extends `Predicate<Student>` will be created.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** Find command is case-insensitive, and the command `find nm/alex` will return the same results.
</div>

Step 3. Classify returns a filtered list of students whose names contain `Alex`. All the details recorded will also be shown.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the find command.

<img src="images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.5 ViewAll command

**Description**

The `viewAll` command displays a list of all student records.

**Implementation**

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interaction between the `Logic` and `Model` components. 

<img src="images/ViewAllCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the ViewAll mechanism behaves at each step. 

Step 1. The user inputs "viewAll". 

Step 2. The `StudentRecordParser` will identify the command and create a `ViewAllCommand` object in the `LogicManager`.

Step 3. `ViewAllCommand#execute` is called which updates the `FilteredStudentList` in `Model`.

Step 4. Classify updates and displays a list of all student records.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.6 ViewClass command

**Description**

The `ViewClassCommand` displays the list of students in a particular class. This feature relies mainly on the `ViewClassCommandParser` and `ClassPredicate`, where the `ViewClassCommandParser` uses `ClassPredicate` to select students in the student record with the mentioned class.

**Implementation**

This command can be divided into 2 main steps: 
1. Parsing the command
2. Executing the command

The following Sequence diagram shows how the `ViewClassCommand` works:

<img src="images/ViewClassCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** The lifeline for `ViewClassCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 1: Parsing the command**

The user's input command is first parsed.

1. `MainWindow` calls the `execute` method of `LogicManager` to execute the given userâ€™s command.
2. Before the command is executed, it is parsed by `StudentRecordParser`, which identifies the command to be a `ViewClassCommand` and creates a new `ViewClassCommandParser` instance to parse the userâ€™s input.
3. `ViewClassCommandParser` checks whether the user input is valid by parsing it into the `parseClass` method in `ParserUtil`.
4. If the input is valid, a new `ClassPredicate` instance is created. 
5. `ViewClassCommandParser` then creates a new `ViewClassCommand` instance which will be executed by the `LogicManager`.

**Step 2: Executing the command**

The `ViewClassCommand` instance now interacts with the `ModelManager` to execute the command.

1. The `updateFilteredStudentList` method is called with the `ClassPredicate` to filter the list to only contain students whose `Class` matches the user input.
2. A new `CommandResult` instance is created and returned to `LogicManager`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** A case-insensitive match is done, hence `viewClass 1a` and `viewClass 1A` will return the same results.
</div>

**Design Considerations**

* Option 1: Integrate `ViewClassCommand` together with `FindCommand`, and users will find students in a specific class.
  * Pros: Users will not need to learn a different command.
  * Cons: There is still a need to differentiate the filter logic as class name requires an exact match, while name only requires it to contain the keywords.
* Option 2 (Current Design): Separate `ViewClassCommand` and `FindCommand`. 
  * Pros: Distinguishing between a `View` and `Find` can make the filtering logic more obvious and apparent to users
  * Cons: Users have an additional command to learn.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.7 ToggleView command

**Description**

The `ToggleViewCommand` toggles the application to display or hide all students' parent details.

**Implementation**

The following activity diagram summarises the events that occur when the user executes the `ToggleViewCommand`.

![ToggleView Activity Diagram](images/ToggleViewCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The `Model`has an association with `FilteredStudent` where `FilteredStudent` encapsulates the current toggle status and `FilteredStudentList`. Executing the command will change the toggle status. The StudentListPanel is dependent on the toggle status in `FilteredStudent` to display or hide the studentsâ€™ parent details properly in the `StudentCard`.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the ToggleView mechanism behaves at each step: 

Step 1. The user enters the command `toggleView`. 

Step 2. The `StudentRecordParser` will identify the command and create a `ToggleViewCommand` object in the `LogicManager`.

Step 3. `ToggleViewCommand#execute` is called which toggles `isConciseInfo` in `FilteredStudent`. 

Step 4. To rerender the update, `ToggleViewCommand` calls `updateFilteredStudentList` with the previously stored predicate. This triggers the listener in `StudentListPanel` to update the `StudentListViewCell`.

Step 5. With the new `isConciseInfo` status, `StudentListViewCell` creates the new `StudentCard` that shows/hides parent details accordingly.  

With the above sequence, the UI is successfully updated to display the relevant student details according to the toggle status. 

**Design Considerations**

- Option 1: Each `Student` has a `isShowingParentDetails` `boolean` attribute.
  - Pros:
    - Does not introduce coupling between UI and Model.
  - Cons: 
    - Each execution of the command edits and replaces all the students in the `FilteredStudentList` with new `Student` objects with the updated attribute which can be costly when there are many student objects.
- Option 2 (Current design): updates `FilteredStudentList` such that it triggers the listener in `StudentListPanel` to update the `StudentListViewCell`. 
  - Pros:
    - No need to edit every student in the `FilteredStudentList`.
    - Attribute is associated with the list and not each student. Only need to maintain 1 attribute.
  - Cons: 
    - Increase coupling between UI and Model.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### 4.2.8 ViewStats command

**Description**

`ViewStatsCommand` is a `Command` to present summary statistics for an `Exam` taken by a particular class of students. 
In particular, the command is implemented to generate the mean score of the `Exam`. The entire process of generating summary statistics is executed in 2 steps. 

**Implementation**

**Step 1: Parsing the command**

The user input is first parsed, in the same way as other commands. After the input is identified to be a viewStats command, a `ViewStatsCommandParser` instance will parse the inputs to retrieve the class and exam of interest.

Furthermore, the command will also be parsed to retrieve an input for an additional `Prefix` "filter/", which will indicate if the list of students returned should be flagged. A flagged list contains only students whose score for that particular `Exam` falls below the mean.

**Step 2: Executing the command**

The `ViewStatsCommand` then interacts with the `ModelManager` to execute the command, which is again done in 2 steps.

Step 1: A `ViewClassCommand` is executed, depending mainly on `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate<Student)`, in order to retrieve the class of interest.

Step 2: The mean of the exam scores for that class is calculated using `Model#calculateMean(String exam)`. 

Depending on the boolean value returned during the parsing of the filter prefix, the class list is further filtered using `Model#updateFilteredStudentList(Predicate<Student)` to show a flagged list. 

The whole list is sorted according to the score of the particular exam, before it is returned and displayed to the user.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram depicts how different components such as `Logic` and `Model` interact.

<img src="images/ViewStatsCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source:
**Note:** The lifeline for `ViewStatsCommandParser` and `ViewClassCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X), but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

**Design Considerations**

Sorting the list of students according to grade
- Option 1: sort the filtered list of students after retrieving the class.
  - Pros:
    - Will not modify the current `StudentRecord`.
    - Will not unnecessarily sort students not in the class of interest.
  - Cons:
    - `FilteredStudents` is meant to be unmodifiable, and sorting potentially breaks this behaviour.
    - `FilteredStudents` is implemented with `FilteredList<Student>` which does not maintain sorting, so additional wrapping needs to be done to sort the filtered list.
- Option 2 (Current design): sort the entire student record, then filter to retrieve class.
  - Pros:
    - Can maintain sorting even beyond the `ViewStats` command, ie. maintaining a sorted list of students, sorted by name, each time an `addStudent` command or `edit` command is run.
  - Cons:
    - Reorders the whole `StudentRecord` each time the sorting is done.

## 6. **Appendix: Requirements**

### 6.1 Product scope

**Target User Profile**

Ministry of Education (MOE) Teachers who:
* Teaches 3 to 5 classes a year.
* Manages about 60 to 100 students with varying needs.
