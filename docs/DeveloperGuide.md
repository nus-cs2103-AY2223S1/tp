### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/boba/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/boba/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`BobaBotModel`**](#bobaBotModel-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete p/87438807`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/boba/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CustomerListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/boba/ui/MainWindow.java) 
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `BobaBotModel` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `BobaBotModel` component, as it displays `Customer` object residing in the `BobaBotModel`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/boba/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `BobaBotParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `BobaBotModel` when it is executed (e.g. to add a customer).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete p/12345678")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete p/1234567` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `BobaBotParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `BobaBotParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Command Classes

The class diagram below expands the details of Command and Parser part in the Logic component above, showing the details of how commands are parsed and created

Simple commands without arguments including `clear` `list` `exit` `help` are created directly by `BobaBotParser`<br/>
To parse complex commands with arguments, including `add` `find` `edit` `delete`, `BobaBotParser` will create customized commandParser corresponding to the command. <br/>
The customized commandParser will parse the arguments and create the command

The diagram also includes some new classes involved. For example, the `find` command depends on new predicates in the `BobaBotModel` component to allow all-info and fuzzy search (more detail in the `find` command description)

<img src="images/CommandClasses.png" width="1200"/>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### BobaBotModel component

**API** : [`BobaBotModel.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/boba/model/BobaBotModel.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `BobaBotModel` component,

* stores the bobaBot data i.e., all `Customer` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueCustomerList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Customer` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Customer>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `BobaBotModel` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) bobaBotModel is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `BobaBot`, which `Customer` references. This allows `BobaBot` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Customer` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/boba/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both bobaBot data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `BobaBotStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `BobaBotModel` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `BobaBotModel`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.boba.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.
### Add feature
The Add feature is facilitated by `LogicManager`. The `AddCommandParser` parses the command arguments, and returns
an `AddCommand` that is executed by the `LogicManager`.

This feature allows the user to add a new Customer.

**Below is a sample usage and how the add sequence behaves at each step.**

1. User chooses the Customer he/she wants to add and enters the command `add n/Bob p/12345678 e/johnd@example.com m/1 r/5000 t/GOLD t/MEMBER`
2. The `LogicManager` redirects this command to `BobaBotParser`, which parses the command via `AddCommandParser` and
   returns the `AddCommand` containing the Customer with all the required fields
3. The `LogicManager` executes the `AddCommand` and Customer is added to database
4. The `CommandResult` reflects this Customer

The following sequence diagram shows how the add feature works, following the flow of entering the command `add n/Bob p/12345678 e/johnd@example.com m/1 r/5000 t/GOLD t/MEMBER`:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following activity diagram summarizes the flow of when a user enters an add command:

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Aspect: How `add` is executed**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can only add a customer with unique `PHONE_NUMBER` and `EMAIL` that does not already exist in database.

  | Pros/Cons | Description                                                                                                                                 | Examples                                                                                                                                                                      |
      |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Pros      | Allows user to add customers with same names but different phone numbers and email addresses                                                | The user can add Alex with phone number `99999999` and a different Alex with phone number `88888888`, where Alex is not a unique name.                                        |
  | Cons      | If an existing customer changes phone number, and a new customer uses this customer's previous phone number, we cannot add the new customer | Alex changes his phone number from `99999999` to `88888888`, Bob got Alex's old phone number `99999999`, we cannot sign Bob up for membership without editing Alex's details. |

* **Alternative 2:** User can only add a customer with unique `NAME`.

  | Pros/Cons | Description                                                                                  | Examples                                                                                                       |
      |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Pros      | Customers can choose not to disclose private details such as phone number and email address. | The user just needs to `add n/Bob` without asking for phone number or email address.                           |
  | Cons      | User cannot add customers that have same names.                                              | The user cannot `add n/Alex` if there already exists an `Alex` in the database, since `Alex` is a common name. |

* **Future Extension:** bobaBot can support autocompletion of prefixes to reduce keystrokes for the user.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Edit feature
The Edit feature is facilitated by `LogicManager`. The `EditCommandParser` parses the command arguments, and returns
an `EditCommand` that is executed by the `LogicManager`.

This feature allows the user to edit any fields of a Customer, and supports editing multiple fields at once.

**Below is a sample usage and how the edit sequence behaves at each step.**

1. User chooses the Customer he/ she wants to edit and enters the command `edit e/test@gmail/com n/Bob`
2. The `LogicManager` redirects this command to `BobaBotParser`, which parses the command via `EditCommandParser` and
returns the `EditCommand` containing the Customer with all the new fields that are supposed to be edited to
3. The `LogicManager` executes the `EditCommand` and Customer to be edited is updated with the new fields
4. The `CommandResult` reflects the changes made to this Customer

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit feature works, following the flow of entering the command `edit e/test@gmail/com n/Bob`:

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following activity diagram summarizes the flow of when a user enters an edit command:

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Aspect: How `edit` is executed**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can edit a customer via either `PHONE_NUMBER` or `EMAIL`.

  | Pros/Cons | Description                                                                          | Examples                                                                                                                                    |
    |--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Pros      | Allows user more flexibility in choosing the inputs as identifiers for editing       | The user can edit any customer as long as they have details of either their `PHONE_NUMBER` or `EMAIL`.                                      |
  | Pros      | The user does not need to know the specific position of the customer within the list | The user can use either identifier `PHONE_NUMBER` or `EMAIL` to edit customers without a need for their index/position.                     |
  | Cons      | The length of the command is longer with the new identifiers                         | The user has to type `edit p/12345678 n/Bob` or `edit e/test@gmail.com n/Bob` to edit a user which is longer compared to editing via index. |

* **Alternative 2:** User can edit a customer via `index`.

  | Pros/Cons | Description                                                                                               | Examples                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
    |-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Pros      | Short commands enable fast editing                                                                        | The user can edit any customer as long as they have details of the `index` of the customer, e.g. `edit 1`.                                                                                                                                          |
  | Cons      | Identifying the customer via `index` might be slow especially when there are customers with similar names | The user has to find out the `index` of the customer to edit before typing the command. Supposed that we want to edit Bob and there exists an Bob and bob, identifying the correct customer takes time and thus delay the execution of the command. |

* **Future Extension:** bobaBot can support multiple editing so user do not have to edit customers one by one.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Increase/ Decrease feature
The Increase/ Decrease feature is facilitated by `LogicManager`. The `IncreaseCommandParser` or `DecreaseCommandParser` parses the command arguments, and returns
an `IncreaseCommand` or `DecreaseCommand` that is executed by the `LogicManager`.

This feature is an extension to the above Edit feature to ease the process of editing Reward points of a Customer.

**Below is a sample usage and how the increase/ decrease sequence behaves at each step.**

1. User chooses the Customer he/ she wants to increase or decrease the Reward points for and enters the command `incr 100 e/test@gmail/com` or `decr 100 e/test@gmail/com`
2. The `LogicManager` redirects this command to `BobaBotParser`, which parses the command via `IncreaseCommandParser` or `DecreaseCommandParser` and
   returns the `IncreaseCommand` or `DecreaseCommand` containing how much to increment or decrement the existing Reward points by
3. The `LogicManager` executes the `IncreaseCommand` or `DecreaseCommand` which implicitly creates and executes the equivalent `EditCommand` for the new Reward value
4. The `CommandResult` reflects the changes made to this Customer

**Pros and Cons are the same as the above Edit Feature.**

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Delete feature
The Delete feature is facilitated by `LogicManager`. The `DeleteCommandParser` parses the command arguments, and returns
a `DeleteCommand` that is executed by the `LogicManager` and returns a `CommandResult` as feedback to the user.

This feature enables the user to remove a customer from bobaBot via either the `PHONE` or `EMAIL` identifier.

**Below is a sample usage and how the delete sequence behaves at each step.**

1. User chooses the Customer he/she wants to delete and enters the command `delete p/12345678`
2. The `MainWindow` class retrieves the user's input and passes it on to the `LogicManager` through the `execute` method
3. The `LogicManager` redirects this command to `BobaBotParser` via the `parseCommand` method and creates a temporary `DeleteCommandParser` object 
4. The `DeleteCommandParser` object parses the command and returns the `DeleteCommand` containing the details of the Customer to delete
5. The `LogicManager` executes the `DeleteCommand`, removing the Customer from bobaBot and returning a `CommandResult` object
6. The `CommandResult` reflects the removal of this Customer

The sequence diagram below shows how the `delete` feature parsing an input `p/12345678` behaves at each step.

**Aspect: How `delete` is executed**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User can delete a customer via either `PHONE_NUMBER` or `EMAIL`.

  | Pros      | Allows user more flexibility in choosing the inputs as identifiers for deletion      | The user can delete any customer as long as they have details of either their `PHONE_NUMBER` or `EMAIL`.                               |
  | Pros      | The user does not need to know the specific position of the customer within the list | The user can use either identifier `PHONE_NUMBER` or `EMAIL` to delete customers without a need for their index/position.              |
  | Cons      | The length of the command is longer with the new identifiers                         | The user has to type `delete p/12345678` or `delete e/test@gmail.com` to delete a user which is longer compared to deleting via index. |

  | Cons      | Identifying the customer via `index` might be slow especially when there are customers with similar names | The user has to find out the `index` of the customer to delete before typing the command. Supposed that we want to delete Alex and there exists an Alex and alex, identifying the correct customer takes time and thus delay the execution of the command.  |

* **Future Extension:** bobaBot can support multiple deletions so user do not have to delete customers one by one.

### Find feature
The Find feature is facilitated by `LogicManager`. The `FindCommandParser` parses the command arguments, and returns
an `FindCommand` that is executed by the `LogicManager`.

This feature allows the user to find a specific user by field, or generally search for occurrences of keywords in all fields.
The feature also supports fuzzy search based on `Soundex` when searching by names.

**Below is a sample usage and how the find sequence behaves at each step.**

1. User chooses the Customer he/ she wants to find and enters the command `find Aschcroft`
2. The `LogicManager` redirects this command to `BobaBotParser`, which parses the command via `FindCommandParser` and
   returns the `FindCommand` containing the predicate
3. The `LogicManager` executes the `FindCommand` and update the filtered list with matching `Customer`
4. The `CommandResult` reflects the number of customers listed

The following sequence diagram shows how the find feature works, following the flow of entering the command `find Aschcroft`:

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following activity diagram summarizes the flow of when a user enters a find command:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
**Aspect: How `find` is executed**
* User can search for a specific customer via `PHONE_NUMBER` or `EMAIL`,
or just search for occurrence of keywords (including name) vaguely.

  | Pros/Cons | Description                                                                     | Examples                                                                                    |
      |---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
  | Pros      | User can find the desired entry easily with a short command                     | For searching a customer with phone number `88888888`, the command `find 88888888` will do. |
  | Pros      | User can also search for a specific entry when needed.                          | For searching the specific customer with email address, use `find e/address@example.com`.   |
  | Cons      | User can exploit the software and get access to irrelevant customer information | User can list out all customers with digit `8` in their phone number by `find 8`.           |



* **Future Extension:** bobaBot can support priority in listing of search results.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### Undo/Redo feature

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedBobaBot`. It extends `BobaBot` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `bobaBotStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedBobaBot#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current bobaBot state in its history if it differs from the previously saved state.
* `VersionedBobaBot#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous bobaBot state from its history as long as it is not in its initialised state.
* `VersionedBobaBot#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone bobaBot state from its history as long as it is not in the most updated state.

These operations are exposed in the `BobaBotModel` interface as `BobaBotModel#commitBobaBot()`, `BobaBotModel#undoBobaBot()` and `BobaBotModel#redoBobaBot()` respectively.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The bobaBotStatelist only keeps track of 20 of the most recent state changes! This is by design to minimise the storage space required for bobaBot application. However, you may configure the limit depending on your needs.

</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedBobaBot` will be initialized with the initial bobaBot state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single bobaBot state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Step 2. The user executes `delete p/87438807` command to delete the customer with phone number `87438807` which corresponds to `Alex Yeoh` from the bobaBot. The `delete` command calls `BobaBotModel#commitBobaBot()`, causing the modified state of the bobaBot after the `delete p/87438807` command executes to be saved in the `bobaBotStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted bobaBot state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new customer. The `add` command also calls `BobaBotModel#commitBobaBot()`, causing another modified bobaBot to be saved into the `bobaBotStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `BobaBotModel#commitBobaBot()`, so the bobaBot state will not be saved into the `bobaBotStateList`.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
Step 4. The user now decides that adding the customer was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `BobaBotModel#undoBobaBot()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous bobaBot state, and restores the bobaBot to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial bobaBot state, then there are no previous bobaBot states to restore. The `undo` command uses `BobaBotModel#canUndoBobaBot()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the `undo` command.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `BobaBotModel#redoBobaBot()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the bobaBot to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `bobaBotStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest bobaBot state, then there are no undone bobaBot states to restore. The `redo` command uses `BobaBotModel#canRedoBobaBot()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the bobaBot, such as `list`, will usually not call `BobaBotModel#commitBobaBot()`, `BobaBotModel#undoBobaBot()` or `BobaBotModel#redoBobaBot()`. Thus, the `bobaBotStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `BobaBotModel#commitBobaBot()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `bobaBotStateList`, all bobaBot states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire bobaBot.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the customer being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
### \[Proposed\] Command history

Command history will allow cashiers to navigate through their previous commands using up and down arrow key.
This is a common feature in CLI, which speed up the operations if cashiers want to do multiple similar commands,
or correct a mistake (Undo first, press the up arrow key to retrieve previous command, then correct the arguments)

**Proposed implementation**

* **Alternative 1:** Keyboard source detection & Save previous user inputs (Similar to the logic of undo/redo)
    * Pros: Easy to implement. As we have implemented undo/redo
    * Cons: May lose command history after cashiers close the app. May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.
