### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bookface/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bookface/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete user 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bookface/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `BookListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files
that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bookface/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Book` objects residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bookface/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `PrimaryParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddUserCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `PrimaryParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddUserCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddUserCommand`) which the `PrimaryParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* Commands can be decomposed into subcommands. For example, to parse `delete user 1`, `PrimaryParser` calls `DeleteCommandParser`. `DeleteCommandParser` then parses `user 1` and returns a `DeleteUserCommand`.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddUserommandParser`, `DeleteUserCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bookface/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores BookFace data i.e., all `Person` objects and all `Book` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object and a `BookList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` and `Book` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` or `ObservableList<Book>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* has a bidirectional association between a `Book` and a `Person`, where a `Book` can only have 0 or 1 loanee `Person`, but a Person can loan 0 or more `Books`
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `BookFace`, which `Person` references. This allows `BookFace` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/bookface/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both BookFace data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `BookFaceStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `bookface.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Command Parsing
The [**Logic**](#logic-component) section briefly explains how the user's input is broken down, but the process is explained more thoroughly here.

This process works by handling the parsing of commands and arguments separately. The first word in the user input is taken to be the command, and the rest of the input to be arguments. A `Command` object is then generated.

One feature is that a command can recursively contain another command as a subcommand. We chose this approach as the `add`, `edit`, `find`, `list`, and `delete` commands can apply to either users or books. These commands need additional subcommands and additional parsers to handle the different execution logic and command-line flags for users and books. Thus, a recursive structure allows for easy extensibility and to share code via parent classes.

Compare the command `loan 1 1` with `delete user 1`. `loan 1 1` has two integer arguments, which cannot be broken down further. However, the arguments `user 1` for `delete` can be treated as a single self-complete subcommand on their own.

#### Design consideration:

This approach was chosen to reduce code duplication and to manage the complexity of `PrimaryParser`. For example, `DeleteUserCommand` (`delete user`) and `DeleteBookCommand` (`delete book`) can share similar code through a common parent `DeleteCommand` (`delete`). Such commands which can contain subcommands like `add` or `delete` also inherit from the abstract `CommandParser`, which has a shared `parse()` method. This proved to be useful, as the `list` command in particular has many subcommands.

These commands (and subcommands) are represented as enums to associate each possible command from the user with a `Parser` specific to that command. Enums were chosen, as they use less memory (as enums are `final` subclasses of `java.lang.Enum`) than `HashMap` for key-value storage, and are easy to modify. Furthermore, they help to ensure type-checking during compile-time, preventing bugs. They also have a semantic value; they represent to both us developers and to readers of the code the current allowed constants.

### Add feature
#### Adding a book/user

The `add` command is an important command that is commonly used in BookFace. It allows the user to add a new book or a user to the system.

#### Design consideration:

Since `add` is used for the operations of both adding a book and adding a user, the enum `AddSubCommand` is created within `Parser` of the `Logic` component to handle differentiating between adding a book and adding a user.

The activity diagram for adding a user or a book is as follows:

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)

#### Adding a book with `add book`

`add book` adds a new book to the model. Specifically, `ModelManager` maintains a list of books and contains the method `addbook()` that is invoked by `AddBookCommand` to perform this adding operation.

The updating of the model is represented in the following sequence diagram:

![AddBookSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Adding a user with `add user`
`add user` follows the same logic and thus closely follows the sequence diagram of `add book`, but uses `AddUserArgumentsParser` and `AddUserCommand` in place of the `add book` variants.

### Delete feature
#### Deleting a book/user
The `delete` allows the user to delete a book or a user from the system.

#### Deleting a book with `delete book`

`delete book` deletes a book from the model. Specifically, `ModelManager` maintains a list of books and contains the method `deleteBook()` that is invoked by `DeleteBookCommand`to perform this deletion.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete user 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Deleting a user with `delete user`
`delete book` deletes a user from the model. Specifically, `ModelManager` maintains a list of users and contains the method `deletePerson()` that is invoked by `DeleteUserCommand` to perform this deletion.

The sequence diagram is rather similar to that of `delete book`, so in the interest of brevity, it has been omitted.

#### Activity Diagram

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the librarian executes a `delete` command:

![DeleteActivityDiagram](images/DeleteActivityDiagram.png)


### List feature

#### Implementation

The list mechanism is facilitated by `LogicManager`. During its process of parsing the command by `PrimaryParser`,
a new `ListCommandParser` will be created to internally parse the argument of the command
through `ListSubcommand`.

Currently, there are 5 possible `Command` classes that can be returned from `ListSubcommand`, and
they are created in respect to the subcommand that is parsed:
* `ListBooksCommand` for `Book` upon the command `list books`
* `ListUsersCommand` for `Person` upon the command `list users`
* `ListAllCommand` for both `Book` and `Person` upon the command `list all`
* `ListLoansCommand` for both `Book` and `Person` upon the command `list loans`
* `ListOverdueCommand` for both `Book` and `Person` upon the command `list overdue`

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list mechanism behaves
at each step.

Step 1. The librarian has executed a `FindUserCommand`, which filtered certain user records to display in BookFace. The librarian
then wants to return the display state to show all user records by entering the `list users` command, which attempts to list all users
in BookFace.

Step 2. `LogicManager` executes the command.

Step 3. `PrimaryParser` then creates a new `ListCommandParser` object, which internally creates a `ListSubcommand` object
to parse the second part of the command (which is `users`).

Step 4. `ListSubcommand` parses the subcommand as an argument and creates a new `ListUsersCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` executes `ListUsersCommand`, which then calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` with a predicate to show all users.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list operation works
(following the steps mentioned above):

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ListUsersCommand`
and `ListUsersCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches
the end of diagram.</div>

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens during the Parse Subcommand action:

![ParseSubcommandActivityDiagram](images/ParseSubcommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find feature is facilitated by `FindUserCommand` and `FindUserArgumentsParser` for finding users, and `FindBookCommand` and `FindBookArgumentsParser` for finding books.
It implements the following operations:
* `updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)` — Display users with names matching predicate.
* `updatedFilteredBookList(predicate)` — Display books with title/authors matching predicate.


Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find users mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. Assume that BookFace contains some users that are added through several `AddUserCommand` executed by the user. The user executes `find user alex` command to find any user with name 'alex' within the address book.

Step 2. `LogicManager` executes the `find user alex` command.

Step 3. PrimaryParser then creates a new `FindUserArgumentsParser` after parsing `find user alex`.

Step 4. `FindUserArgumentsParser` parses `"alex"` and creates a new `FindUserCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` executes the `FindUserCommand`.

Step 6. `FindUserCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList("alex")`  and find all users with names matching "alex".

Step 7. `FindUserCommand` creates new `CommandResult` and returns the result to `LogicManager`.


The following sequence diagram shows a visualization of the above find process:

![FindUserSequenceDiagram](images/FindUserSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the librarian executes a find user command:

![FindUserActivityDiagram](images/FindUserActivityDiagram.png)

The process for finding books goes through a similar process as the process for finding users. Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find books mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. Assume that BookFace contains some books that are added through several `AddBookCommand` executed by the user. The user executes `find book moby` command to find any book with title or author with 'moby' within the book list.

Step 2. `LogicManager` executes the `find book moby` command.

Step 3. PrimaryParser then creates a new `FindBookArgumentsParser` after parsing `find book moby`.

Step 4. `FindBookArgumentsParser` parses `"moby"` and creates a new `FindBookCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` executes the `FindBookCommand`.

Step 6. `FindBookCommand` calls `Model#updateFilteredBookList("moby")`  and find all books with titles or authors matching "moby".

Step 7. `FindBookCommand` creates new `CommandResult` and returns the result to `LogicManager`.


The following sequence diagram shows a visualization of the above find process:

![FindBookSequenceDiagram](images/FindBookSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the librarian executes a find command:

![FindBookActivityDiagram](images/FindBookActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations
The find command is designed such that the matches within `BookList` and `UniquePersonList` are easily found and listed onto the UI of BookFace.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Loan feature

#### Implementation

The loan mechanism is facilitated by `LoanCommandParser` and `LoanCommand`. It implements the following operation:
* `BookFace#loan()` — Loans to the specified user a specified book.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#loan()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the loan mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. Assume that FaceBook contains some users and some books that are added through several `AddUserCommand` and `AddBookCommand`
executed by the librarian. The librarian then enters `loan 2 2` command to loan to the 2nd user in the user list the 2nd book
in the book list.

Step 2. `LogicManager` executes the librarian's `loan 2 2` command.

Step 3. `PrimaryParser` then creates a new `LoanCommandParser` after parsing `loan 2 2`.

Step 4. `LoanCommandParser` parses `2 2` and creates a new `LoanCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` executes `LoanCommand`.

Step 6. `LoanCommand` calls `Model#Loan()` and loans the 2nd user in the user list the 2nd book
in the book list.

Step 7. `LoanCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` and returns the result to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the loan operation works:

![LoanSequenceDiagram](images/LoanSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `LoanCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when the librarian executes a loan command:

![LoanActivityDiagram](images/LoanActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:
The loan command is designed such that the `BookList` and `UniquePersonList`
are updated sequentially rather than concurrently, such that there are
separate loan commands in both `BookList` and `UniquePersonList` that are called
by `BookFace` that updates the `BookList` and `UniquePersonList` respectively.

We wanted to avoid the design such that both `Book` and `Person` were associated with each other 
directly (ie. can access details of each other) to reduce coupling. Currently, `Person` contains a `Set` of loaned books
while `Book` contains a `loanee` and a `returnDate` and the loan command updates all the attributes of `Person`
and `Book` separately.

One issue is that the `UniquePersonList` and `BookList` do not refresh their UI
automatically, and we resorted to getting the index of each list to set their
internal `ObservableLists` to 'refresh' their UI.

We have chosen to use an external `PrettyTimeParser` library here to allow for higher degrees of flexibility for input. One downside however is that it uses Natural Language Processing, and it may cause unintended parsing behaviours that is difficult to resolve since Natural Language Processing is beyond the scope of this module. In this case, invalid dates such as `2075-99-99` are accepted as valid dates by the library, and we have decided to check only for the two most common date formats, `dd/MM/yyyy` and `yyyy-MM-dd`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Return feature

#### Implementation

Similar to the loan mechanism, the return mechanism is facilitated by `ReturnCommandParser` and `ReturnCommand`. It implements the following operation:
* `BookFace#returnLoanedBook()` — returns a loaned book.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#returnLoanedBook()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the return mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. Assume that FaceBook contains some users and some books that are added through several `AddUserCommand` and `AddBookCommand`
executed by the librarian. The librarian then enters `loan 2 2` command to loan to the 2nd user in the user list the 2nd book
in the book list. The librarian now wants to return the 2nd book that was previously loaned out.
The librarian enters `return 2` command.

Step 2. `LogicManager` executes the librarian's `return 2` command.

Step 3. `PrimaryParser` then creates a new `ReturnCommandParser` after parsing `return 2`.

Step 4. `ReturnCommandParser` parses `2` and creates a new `ReturnCommand`.

Step 5. `LogicManager` executes `ReturnCommand`.

Step 6. `ReturnCommand` calls `Model#returnLoanedBook()` and returns the 2nd book in the book list.

Step 7. `ReturnCommand` creates a new `CommandResult` and returns the result to `LogicManager`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the return operation works:

![ReturnSequenceDiagram](images/ReturnSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ReturnCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a return command:

![ReturnActivityDiagram](images/ReturnActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations:
Similar to Design considerations for the loan command.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* librarians managing a small library
* has a need to manage a significant number of patrons
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast and is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* has no access to card-based systems to manage loans

**Value proposition**: Our app replaces a paper-based system or manual tracking of books, providing greater speed/efficiency in identifying where a book is, or when it is due. It also adds a member-tracking system to handle an increasing number of library members.

## **Appendix: Effort**

* **Difficulty level**<br>
  Creating the `Book` entity alone was somewhat viable for us to do. However, it became quite difficult when multiple variables come into play with `Book`. For instance, integrating `Loan` into `Book` and `Person` meant that we had to ensure any data that is to be created or modified are performed correctly and synchronized with one another (E.g. A `Person`'s loaned book status should reflect all `Book` records that were loaned specifically to that `Person`). Parsing the various commands was the most difficult part of the project since the main commands like `Add` and `Edit` now involved more than 1 entity (unlike in AddressBook), and thus made the product more prone to errors and unexpected bugs from a multitude of possible inputs.
* **Challenges faced**<br>
  * Changing of features due to multiple implementations;<br>
    Some features are related to one another (E.g. `Book` and `Loan`), and that made implementations difficult to synchronise, especially when multiple people are modifying them to suit their specific tasks. For instance, if `Book` were to have a quantity variable, `Loan` needs to be modified such that it can keep track of the `Book` quantity and the record is synchronised correctly with `Person`. However, if `Loan` and `Book` are in the middle of an enhancement, it becomes extremely tough to ensure our implementations work with these enhancements.
