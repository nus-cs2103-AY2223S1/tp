### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -p 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `InternshipListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `DeletePersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to delete a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -p 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -p 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
The **API** of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<br>
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F11-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit Internship

#### Implementation

Given below is an example usage scenario.

1. InterNUS shows a list of internships. The user edits the first internship in the list using the command `edit -i 1 s/R`.
2. The command is accepted by the `Logic` component, which passes it to the `AddressBookParser`.
3. The `AddressBookParser` creates the corresponding parser, `EditInternshipCommandParser` to parse the arguments `1 s/R`.
4. The parser stores the details to edit in an `EditInternshipDescriptor`. The parser also creates an `EditInternshipCommand` with the index `1` and the descriptor as arguments.
5. The `EditInternshipCommand` is returned to the `LogicManager`, which then calls its `execute()` method.
6. To retrieve the list of internships, `Model#getFilteredInternshipList()` is called. The target internship (the one at index `1`) is retrieved from the `FilteredList`. An updated `Internship` is also created via a self invocation: `createEditedInternship()`.
7. `Model#setInternship()` is called to replace the target internship with the updated internship.
8. `Model#updateFilteredInternshipList()` is called to update the internship list to display all internships.
9. Finally, `EditInternshipCommand` creates a `CommandResult` to denote that the operation is completed, and returns this `CommandResult` back to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram is given below (some details are omitted, such as the instantiation of the `EditInternshipDescriptor`).
![EditInternshipSequence](images/EditInternshipSequence.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `EditInternshipCommand`:
![EditInternshipActivity](images/EditInternshipActivity.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sort Person list

#### Implementation

1. When the user sorts the person list, the command goes through the `LogicManager`, which will then go through the `AddressBookParser`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` will then create the corresponding parser for the command, which is `SortPersonCommandParser`.
3. After which, it will pass the argument (the full command excluding the command word and flag) to this parser.
4. The command parser will then create a `SortPersonCommand` with the corresponding internal variable (`n/` means sort by name, `c/` means sort by associated company name). This is facilitated by the `Criteria` enumeration.
5. The method then returns all the way back to `LogicManager`, which is then stored as a variable called `command`.
6. Then, the command is executed by calling the `execute()` method of `SortPersonCommand` (the command that was returned earlier) directly.
7. Based on its internal variable, it will call `sortPersonlist()` in the `Model` class on the person list, and passes the sort criterion.
8. The person list will then set the comparator based on the criterion that was passed earlier, and the list is sorted based on that comparator.
9. Afterwards, `SortPersonCommand` creates a `CommandResult` to denote that the operation is completed, and returns this `CommandResult` back to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram is given below.
![SortPersonSequence](images/SortPersonSequence.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user attempts to sort the person list:
![SortPersonActivity](images/SortPersonActivity.png)

#### Design considerations

The sorting mechanism is designed in a way to keep all operations to the `SortPersonCommand` object itself, 
which will them prompt the `Model` to set the comparator of the person list. 
This is consistent with the other commands, as they will go through the same process, since each command has their own class and parser (if needed).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find Person

#### Implementation

1. When the user attempts to find a person or internship, the command goes through the `LogicManager`, which will then go through the `AddressBookParser`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` will then create the corresponding parser for the command, `FindPersonCommandParser`.
3. After which, it will pass the argument (the full command excluding the command word and flag) to this parser.
4. The command parser will then create a `FindPersonCommand` by constructing and storing a `predicate` that checks, 
   for each field of the `Person`, whether it contains any of the specified keywords.
   The determining of which keyword is for which field is done via parsing of prefixes in the command,
   and these prefixes are consistent with the ones used in other commands such as the `Add` command.
5. The method returns a `Command` to the `LogicManager` which is stored as a variable called `command`.
6. This `command` is executed by calling its `execute()` method.
7. This will invoke the `updateFilteredPersonList` method of the `model` with the `predicate` that was constructed earlier.
8. The `predicate` will then be passed to the `filteredPersonList` of the `model` and used to filter the list via `setPredicate`.
9. Afterwards, `FindPersonCommand` creates a `CommandResult` to denote that the operation is completed, and returns this `CommandResult` back to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram is given below.
![FindPersonSequence](images/FindPersonSequence.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user attempts to find a person:
![FindPersonActivity](images/FindPersonActivity.png)

#### Design considerations

The finding mechanism is designed in a way to keep all operations to the `FindPersonCommand` object itself,
which will them prompt the `Model` to set the predicate of the person list.
This is consistent with the other commands, as they will go through the same process, since each command has their own class and parser (if needed).

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Link Person and Internship

#### Implementation

1. When the user attempts to link a person amd an internship, the command goes through the `LogicManager`, which will then go through the `AddressBookParser`.
2. The `AddressBookParser` will then create the corresponding parser for the command, `LinkCommandParser`.
3. After which, it will pass the argument (the full command excluding the command word and flag) to this parser.
4. The command parser will then create a `LinkCommand` with the specified person index and internship index.
5. The method then returns all the way back to `LogicManager`, which is then stored as a variable called `command`.
6. This `command` is executed by calling its `execute()` method.
7. This will invoke the `getFilteredPersonList` and `getFilteredInternshipList` methods of the `model`
8. Based on this `command` specified person index and internship index, the respective person and internship will be fetched from the internal person list and internship list in InterNUS. New `Person` and `Internship` objects will be created with the fields `internshipId` and `contactPersonId` updated respectively.
9. `setPerson` and `setInternship` methods of the `model` will be invoked to update the person and internship in InterNUS.
11. Afterwards, `LinkCommand` creates a `CommandResult` to denote that the operation is completed, and returns this `CommandResult` back to `LogicManager`.

The sequence diagram is given below.
