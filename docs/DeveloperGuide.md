### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.

- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.

- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.

- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- take user commands from `CommandBox` and executes user commands via the `Logic` component.

  - The `UI` component therefore keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.

- listens for changes to the data within the `Model` component and updates the UI with any modified data.

  - This means that the `UI` component depends on some classes in the `Model` component (for example, `PersonCard` and `ReminderCard` displays information that is set in the `Model` component).

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.

2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.

3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).

4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data, which includes:

  - all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).

  - all `Tag` objects in a set (which are contained in a `TagSet` object).

  - all `Message` objects in a List that represents the message templates (which are contained in a `MessageList` object).

- stores the currently _filtered_ `Person` objects (i.e. results of a `filter` command) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`.

  - The `UI` component updates the `PersonListPanel` JavaFx component to match the components in the `ObservableList` whenever the data in the filtered list change.

- stores the currently _selected_ `Person` object (i.e. result of a `show` command) as a `TargetPerson` which is exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>`.

  - Similarly, the `UI` component updates the `TargetPersonPanel` JavaFx component ot match the data that is in the `ObservableList` whenever the `TargetPerson` is changed.

- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.

- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` component acts as a "database" which represents data entities, and the data entities should work on their own without depending on other components)

Given below is the class diagram for the `Person` model.

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data, user preference data and reminder data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.

- inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `UserPrefStorage` and `ReminderListStorage`, which means it can be treated as any of them (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### UI Design

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed design for the UI is to follow the [Material Design system](https://m2.material.io/design/) as much as possible.
However, due to limitations of JavaFx, we will only be mainly focusing on adhering the color system
and typography, with the other foundations serving more of a guide for future component designs.

The main stylesheet can be found under `resources/view/LightTheme.css`. The primary color chosen is `#9837d9`, with the full color palette shown below.

![colorpalette](images/colorpalette.jpg)

#### Design considerations:

- **Aspect: The application only supports a light theme**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only implement a light theme.

  * Pros:
    - Most applications are light themed by default, thus only support light theme for consistency.

    - Only need to maintain one stylesheet.

  - Cons:

    * User may have enabled system-wide dark mode, so the light theme of Rapportbook may not blend in with other
      applications nicely.

* **Alternative 2:** Implement both light theme and dark theme and follow user's system light/dark mode setting.

  - Pros:

    - Current theme will blend in with other applications on the system nicely.
  * Cons:
    - Extra manpower is required to maintain two different stylesheets.
    * [There is still no official way to detect system-wide light/dark mode setting in Java yet without the use of a third-party library.](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60323132)

### Remark field for entries

#### Implementation

The proposed implementation for Remark is similar to that of other details of Person.
Firstly we include a Remark class under `seedu/address/model/person`.
This class will contain all details about a remark, namely its Regex requirements and
the string which is the remark itself.

Note that a Remark field is optional when adding a Person entry into the AddressBook.
Hence, the default value for a Remark is an empty String.

There are only 2 commands which can modify the Remark for a Person. These are the
`add` command and the `edit` command.

1. `add` Command (upon instantiating)

   1. If the remark field is specified when instantiating a Person, for example:
      `add n=JohnDoe p=98765432 e=JohnDoe@gmail.com a=Clementi r=REMARK`, their remark
      will be REMARK.

   2. If not specified, it will be an empty String.

2. `edit` Command (after instantiating)

   1. If the remark field is specified when editing a Person, for example:
      `edit 1 r=Change Remark`, their remark will be changed to ChangeRemark.

   2. If not specified, it will remain unchanged.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How remark can be modified:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Only at `add` and `edit` command.

  * Pros:
    - Reduces cluttering of commands.

    - More intuitive design as it agrees with the definition of `add` and `edit`.
  * Cons:
    - Extra typing (`r=New Remark`) to modify the Remark field.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a `remark` command just to modify remarks.

  * Pros:
    - Slightly less typing when editing Remark.
  * Cons:
    - Remark is just like any other field, just like name and address.
      Hence, it is by no mean special and does not deserve its own command.
    * `edit` command no longer agrees with its definition to edit entries.

### Message command

#### Implementation

The `message` command provides an easy way for users to generate messages to send to clients, using pre-written message templates which contain the {name} keyword. Message templates are stored as an array of strings in the address book JSON file.

The following commands are provided:

- `create` â€‰â€” Create a message template
* `delete` â€‰â€” Delete the specified message template

* `generate` â€‰â€” Using the specified message template and client, generate a message for client.

Creation and deletion are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#createMessage`, `Model#deleteMessage`, while message generation is exposed in `Message` as `Message#generate`.

The following class diagram shows how messages are implemented:

![MessageClassDiagram](images/MessageClassDiagram.png)

**Given below is an example usage scenario of message generation**

Step 1. The user creates a message template. A new `Message` object is created in `CreateMessageParser`. Then, `CreateMessageCommand#execute()` calls `ModelManager#createMessage()`, which calls `AddressBook#createMessage()`, which adds the message into `AddressBook#messages`

```
message create Hello {name}, long time no see! Are you free tomorrow?
```

Step 2: The user generates a message template for Bob (id=4 in the list), an early-stage client. In `GenerateMessageCommand#execute()`, {name} is replaced with the target person's `fullName`.

```
message generate 4 1
```

*Hello Bob, long time no see! Are you free tomorrow? I'd like to share something exciting with you!*

Step 3: The user realizes his first attempt at a pitch isn't working well, so they delete the message from the address book. `DeleteMessageCommand#execute()` calls `ModelManager#deleteMessage()`, which calls `AddressBook#deleteMessage()`, which deletes the message from `AddressBook#messages`

```
message delete 1
```

#### Design considerations:

- **Aspect: Allow editing:**

  - Alternative 1 (current choice): Don't allow editing

    - Pros: Simpler command set, easier to implement, messages templates are not frequently edited

    - Cons: Less convenient when user actually wants to edit message templates

  - Alternative 2: Allow editing

    - Pros: (Slightly) more convenient

    - Cons: More complicated command set

### Tag command

#### Implementation

The proposed implementation for Tags is similar to that of other details of Person.
However, it is important to note that a tag needs to be created before it can be used.
Firstly we include a `tag` package under `seedu/address/model`.
This package will contain a tag class with all details about a tag, namely its Regex requirements and
the string which is the remark itself. The package also contains a TagSet class which stores all
tags created under a set.

The following class diagram illustrates how Tag is implemented:

![TagClassDiagram](images/TagClassDiagram.png)

Note that a Tag field is optional when adding a Person entry into the AddressBook.
Hence, the default value for a Tag is an empty String.

We can create tags using the `tag create` command. For example, `tag create friends`.

The following sequence diagram illustrates the mechanism behind creating a tag:

1. Upon executing the CreateTag Command, all the tags passed in by the user are passed through a loop to check if they already exist, via `Model#hasTag(tag)`.
2. In the event that they exist, they will be stored in a list to inform the user later.
3. In the event that it does not exist, it will be created by calling `Model#add(tag)`.
4. If there were existing tags being passed in by the user, a message to notify the user will be generated out and printed along the success message.

![CreateTagSequenceDiagram](images/CreateTagSequenceDiagram.png)

Now that we have created a tag, we can tag a client using the `tag` command. For example, `tag 1 friends`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates how tagging works:

1. Upon executing the Tag Command, the `model`'s `getFilteredPersonList()` is called to obtain the list of users.
2. With the list of users, we are now able to identify the client to tag. We then obtain the tags he/she currently have via `Person#getTags()`.
3. Now we can add the new tags to this particular client.
4. Next, we call `Model#setPerson(personToTag, taggedPerson)` to update the client's tags.
5. Lastly, we call `Model#clearFiltersInFilteredPersonList()` to update our list of users.

![TagSequenceDiagram](images/TagSequenceDiagram.png)

We can also remove tags from a user using the `tag remove` command. For example, `tag remove 1 friends`.

To remove all instances of a tag, we can use the `tag delete` command. For example, `tag delete friends`.

The following sequence diagram describes how the deletion of tags is done:

1. Upon executing the DeleteTag Command, the command calls the `model`'s deleteTags method to delete the tags.

![DeleteTagSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteTagSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How tags can be implemented:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Using a separate set of commands labelled `tag`.

  - Pros:

    - A cleaner design as tags, unlike remarks are elements of a set, rather than a String.

  - Cons:

    - Forces the creation of a few unique commands. Not user-friendly as the user is expected to memorize all commands.

* **Alternative 2:** Building on top of the `add` and `edit` commands.

  * Pros:
    * It allows a more concise set of operations.
  * Cons:`
    - `add` and `edit` commands will be slightly messier and may contain ambiguities.
    * Not user-friendly. The user will be forced to re-type all the current tags the client possesses if they wish to add or edit one of the many tags the client possesses.

### Filter Command

#### Implementation

The `filter`command provides a way for users to search for clients in Rapportbook. It extends from the `Command` class and results in an update of the `FilteredList<Person>` filtered list of the model.

The following commands are provided:

- `filter list`â€‰â€” Lists all applied filters
* `filter [n=NAME,...] [t=TAG,...]` â€‰â€” Filter for clients with the specified names and tags

* `filter clear [n=NAME,...] [t=TAG,...]` â€‰â€” Removes filters that were previously applied with the specified names or tags

The command utilizes the  `FilterCommandPredicate` class to aggregate the filters specified and handle the filtering. `FilterCommandPredicate` is created during parsing when `filter` commands are executed. The following is the sequence diagram for parsing of the `filter` command.

![FilterParseSequenceDiagram](images/command-filter/FilterParseSequenceDiagram.svg)

Adding and removing filters are exposed in the `Model` through the `Model#addNewFilterToFilteredPersonList` and `Model#removeFilterFromFilteredPersonList` methods. Additionally, there is also the `Model#clearFiltersInFilteredPersonList` method to clear all filters.

![FilterClassDiagram](images/command-filter/FilterClassDiagram.svg)

Predicates of each type of filter (name and tags) are stored in separate sets in the `ModelManager` class. Adding a filter will add predicates to the sets and removing filters will remove them from the sets. To update the `FilteredList` with the updated filters, each set of predicate will be reduced with an `OR` operation, and the resulting predicate from each set will be reduced with an `AND` operation.

The following is a sequence diagram of a `filter` command. This diagram applies to both `filter clear` and `filter list` except that in `filter clear`,  `Model#clearFiltersInFilteredPersonList` is called and `filter list` does not change the the `FilteredList` of the model.

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/command-filter/FilterSequenceDiagram.svg)

**Given below is an example usage scenario of filtering**

Step 1: The user wants to filter the for he tagged as `rich` and `fun`.

```
filter t=rich,fun
```

Step 2: In the list returned, the user notices the names, `Bob`, `Alan`, which he has interests in. He can filter for them, so that they appear beside each other.

```
filter n=bob,alan
```

Step 3: After looking through their details, the user wants to look at other `rich` and `fun` clients in his contact. To do this, he can clear the name filters.

```
filter clear n=bob,alan
```

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How filters are reduced:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** filters of the same type are reduced with `OR` and filters of different types are reduced with `AND`.

  - Pros:

    - Simple to implement

    - Follows the same filtering pattern used by most websites

  - Cons:

    - It might be unintuitive for the user to see the list expanding after a new filter is applied.

* **Alternative 2:** filters in the same command are reduced with `OR` and filters in separate commands are reduced with `AND`.

  - Pros:

    - Provides a lot of flexibility for the user

  - Cons:

    - Difficult to test as there are many different cases

    - Difficult to implement clearing of filters in a sensible and intuitive manner

### Show command

#### Implementation

The `show` command allows the user to target a single client so that details about that client can be changed easily.

To facilitate the `show` command, a `TargetPerson` class is created to store the target `Person`. Methods to store and retrieve the `TargetPerson` are exposed in the `Model`interface. Storing the `Person` object of interest in a separate class allows it to be retrieved easily for later use.

The following class diagram shows how the `TargetPerson` is implemented:
![TargetPerson0](images/TargetPersonClassDiagram.png)

Commands that integrates with the `show` command includes:

- `edit`

- `tag`

- `reminder`

**Given below is an example usage scenario of show command**

Step 1: The user types "show 1" to target the client at index 1 of the current list.

```
show 1
```

Step 2: The user edits the current target details, without the need to specify an index.

```
edit n=Alexis Yeoh
```

Step 3: The user tags the current target with the tag `friends`, without the need to specify an index.

```
tag friends
```

#### Design considerations:

- **Aspect: How to access the `TargetPerson`:**
  - Alternative 1 (current choice): Allow the index to not be specified
    - Pros:
      - The user does not have to provide an index (less to type).
    - Cons:
      - Implementation will have to account for no index provided for the various commands.
  - Alternative 2: Index 0 to denote `TargetPerson`
    - Pros:
      - (Slightly) Easier to implement.
    - Cons:
      - User has to provide an index (more to type).

### Reminders

#### Implementation

The `reminder`command provides a way for users to add reminders for clients in Rapportbook.

The following commands are provided:

- `reminder [INDEX] d=DESCRIPTION dt=YY-M-D H:m`â€‰â€” Adds a reminder for the specified client if INDEX is provided, otherwise adds a reminder for the target client shown using the `show` command.
* `reminder delete INDEX` â€‰â€” Deletes a reminder from the displayed reminder list using the reminder index.

* `reminder clear` â€‰â€” Clears all reminders from the displayed reminder list.

Given below is the class diagram for reminders. `ReminderList` will sort `Reminder` objects by the earliest date and time of a reminder.

<img src="images/ReminderClassDiagram.png" width="300">

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** As of now, each `Reminder` object contains the `Name` and `Phone` objects which are used as foreign keys to identify which `Person` object the `Reminder` belongs to. This is a workaround and we may implement unique primary keys for `Person` in the future.<br>

</div>

**Given below is an example usage scenario of reminder**

Step 1: Clear all reminders in the currently displayed reminder list.

```
reminder clear
```

Step 2: Create a reminder for the client at index 1 of the currently displayed reminder list with description `Zoom meeting`, date `30 November 2022` and time `11:00 AM`.

```
reminder 1 d=Zoom meeting dt=22-11-30 11:00
```

#### Design considerations:

- **Aspect: Storage for reminders:**

  - Alternative 1 (current choice): Store reminders in a separate JSON file.

    - Pros:

      - Reduced data coupling between contacts and remindersâ€‰â€” Corrupted data in reminders will not cause the application to fail to load the address book data.

    - Cons:

      - More tedious to implement.

      - An extra file the user needs to keep track of when transferring data.

- Alternative 2: Store all reminders in the address book JSON file

  - Pros:

    - Easier to implement.

  - Cons:

    - Data couplingâ€‰â€” A pre-existing database may fail to load due to changes in how address book or reminders data are stored, and data coupling will increase the amount of data that fails to load.

### Motivational quotes

#### Implementation

As an encouragement, Rapportbook will show a motivational quote on the starting page of Rapportbook. The quote is randomly selected from a list of 300 quotes, and will not change until Rapportbook is restarted.

The quotes are stored as a static list, in the `QuoteList` class. As this class has only static variables and methods, it should not be instantiated and hence does not have a constructor. The following is the class diagram for this feature.

![QuoteListClassDiagram](images/motivational-quote/QuoteListClassDiagram.png)

To access a quote, the class provides the `QuoteList#getRandomQuote()` method which will return a random quote from the quote list. Once the `getRandomQuote()` method has been called, the quote returned will be stored as a static variable, which will be used as the return value for subsequent calls.

#### Design considerations:

- **Aspect: How the quotes are stored.**

  - Alternative 1 (current choice): Stored as a static variable in a class

    - Pros:

      - Easy to implement.

    - Cons:
      - Every quote will be loaded into memory even though only 1 quote is used.

  - Alternative 2: Stored in a JSON file

    - Pros:

      - Reduces memory use.
      - Allows users to add their own quotes.

    - Cons:

      - High effort for a small feature.
