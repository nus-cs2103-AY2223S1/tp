### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### `student` command to add students' contacts (modification of AB3 `add` command)

#### Implementation

The `student`, `prof` and `ta` commands add students, Professors and Teaching Assistant's Contact into the contact list. Since `student`, `prof` and `ta` commands are similar in nature, we will only discuss about `student` command here.

The adding of students' contacts is facilitated by `StudentCommand`. It extends `Command` with a `Person` field that refers to the `Student` that is going to be added into the contact list. Note that `Student` extends from `Person`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* StudentCommand#execute() - Executes the Student command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how adding of student operation mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types `student n/John Doe m/CS4226 m/CS5242 p/98765432 e/JohnD@example.com g/M` and presses enter.

Step 2. The `student n/John Doe m/CS4226 m/CS5242 p/98765432 e/JohnD@example.com g/M` will be parsed by `AddressBook#parseCommand()` which will return a `StudentCommandParser`.

Step 3. The `StudentCommandParser` will parse `n/John Doe m/CS4226 m/CS5242 p/98765432 e/JohnD@example.com g/M` using `parse()`. This will return a `StudentCommand`

Step 4. The `StudentCommand` will then be executed using `StudentCommand#execute()`.

Step 5. The `Model#addPerson(Person)` method will be called and the student will be added into the contact list.

Step 6. A `CommandResult` indicating successful completion of the command will be returned.


The sequence diagram below shows how a `StudentCommand` is executed. Due to space constraints `student n/John Doe m/CS4226 m/CS5242 p/98765432 e/JohnD@example.com g/M` is shortened to command and `n/John Doe m/CS4226 m/CS5242 p/98765432 e/JohnD@example.com g/M` is shortened to studentDetails.

![StudentCommandSequenceDiagram](images/StudentCommandSequenceDiagram.png)



### Delete multiple contacts (enhancement to delete feature)

`DeleteCommand` now accepts multiple inputs and allows multiple `Person` to be deleted from the `Model` in a single command.

The sequence diagram below shows how a `DeleteCommand` with multiple inputs is executed.

<img src="images/DeleteMultipleSequenceDiagram.png" >

#### Differences from original `DeleteCommand` implementation:
1. `DeleteCommandParser` now returns a `Set<Index>` instead of just a single `Index` to be used as arguments for the `DeleteCommand`constructor.
2. If any of the inputs are invalid (out of bounds indexes or non-integer characters) a `ParseException` will be thrown, even if other inputs are valid.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The order of the inputs does not matter as the set is sorted in reverse order before creating the `DeleteCommand` object. This ensures that deletion of each entry in the `model` does not affect the deletion of the subsequent entries while the `for` loop is running.
</div>

### Fast Template Feature

#### Implementation

The Fast Template Feature is facilitated by `TemplateCommand`. It extends 'Command' with a String`personChosen` class field that stores the chosen Person. The chosen Person refers to the Person that the User wants the template of, i.e. `prof / ta / student`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:
- TemplateCommand#execute() - Executes the template command, whose command word is `tt`.
- TemplateCommand#isValidPerson(String p) - Returns the boolean indicating whether the string p refers to a valid person. I.e. is a command word for a Person

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the template operation mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types `tt prof` and presses enter.

Step 2. The `tt prof ` will be parsed by `AddressBook#parseCommand()` which will return a `TemplateCommandParser`.

Step 3. The `TemplateCommandParser` will parse `prof` using `parse()`. This will return a `TemplateCommand` since `prof` is a valid command word for a Person, in this case Professor.

Step 4. The `TemplateCommand` will then be executed using `TemplateCommand#execute()`.

Step 5. A `CommandResult` will be returned. It has the field `personTemplateString` that is set to `"prof"`.

Step 6. The UI will call `hasPersonTemplate()` from the CommandResult.

Step 7. If the previous step is true, the UI will update itself accordingly, i.e. paste the appropriate Person's template on the CLI, by calling `handleTemplate()`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the github feature works.

![ttCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ttCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How the template is provided to User:**

* **Current Implementation:** Pastes the template directly into the CLI where the User types commands
    * Pros: More intuitive
    * Cons: More complicated to implement, need to click or press tab + left arrow to get to CLI.

* **Alternative:** Copies the template into the User's clipboard
    * Pros: Easier to implement, can access CLI directly after pasting
    * Cons: Less intuitive, less technically competent users may not understand what a clipboard is.

### Open Github Profile Page Feature

#### Implementation

The Open Github Profile Page Feature is facilitated by `GithubCommand`. It extends `Command` with an `Index` field that stores the target index. The target index refers to the index of the Address that users want to execute the GitHub command on. Additionally, it implements the following operations:
- GithubCommand#execute() - Executes the GitHub command.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the GitHub operation mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types `github 1` and presses enter.

Step 2. The `github 1 ` will be parsed by `AddressBook#parseCommand()` which will return a `GithubCommandParser`.

Step 3. The `GithubCommandParser` will parse `1` using `parse()`. This will return a `GithubCommand`

Step 4. The `GithubCommand` will then be executed using `GithubCommand#execute()`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** executes() checks if the GitHub username field of target person is empty. If it is empty an exception will be thrown.
</div>

Step 5. The `Model#openGithub(Person)` method will be called and the githubProfile page associated to target contact would be opened on the user's default browser using `java.awt.Desktop.getDesktop.browse(uri)`.

Step 6. A `CommandResult` indicating successful completion of the command will be returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the GitHub feature works.

![GithubSequenceDiagram](images/GithubCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new GitHub command:

![GithubSequenceDiagram](images/GithubCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How open GitHub profile page feature executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Opens GitHub profile page through user's default browser.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Users will be redirected to their default browser.

* **Alternative 2:** Opens GitHub profile page through in-built browser.
    * Pros: Users will be able to see the GitHub profile page from the app itself
    * Cons: Difficult to implement. (need to build browser on app, need to reserve UI space for it)

### Find Contact

#### Implementation

The Find Contact Feature is facilitated by `FindCommand`. It extends `Command` and uses the `PersonMatchesPredicate` field (which implements the `Predicate` interface).

`PersonMatchesPredicate` encapsulates all the required filters the user enters. `FindCommand` then uses the `test` method of the `Predicate` interface to filter contacts one at a time.

`PersonMatchesPredicate` uses `ALL` search for fields,
but `OR` search inside fields. e.g. `find n/bob ann t/friend` will return contacts named `bob` and `ann` if both contacts have the tag `friend`. Whereas `find t/friend owesMoney` would just return all contacts who have the tag `friend` OR `owesMoney`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types `find n/bob t/friend` and presses enter.

Step 2. The `find n/bob` will be parsed by `AddressBook#parseCommand()` which will return a `FindCommandParser` which also creates a `PersonMatchesPredicate`.

Step 3. The `FindCommandParser` will parse `n/bob t/friend` using `parse(args)`. `parse(args)` creates a `List` of strings from the arguments of `n/` and a `Set` of strings from the arguments of `t/`. It then set the `namesList` of the `PersonMatchesPredicate` to the list of strings sets the `tagSet` of `PersonMatchesPredicate` to the set of strings.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** `FindCommand` supports an "all fields matched" mode and "any fields matched" for module codes and tags. This means the setting of the modulesSet and tagsSet works differently than the other fields.
</div>


Step 4. `FindCommandParser` then creates a `FindCommand` by passing the `PersonMatchesPredicate` to its constructor.

Step 5. The `FindCommand` will then be executed using `FindCommand#execute(model)`.

Step 6. The `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate);` method will be called and the list of persons will be filtered according to the `PersonMatchesPredicate`. Persons whose names contain `bob` AND have the tag `friend` would match.

Step 7. A `CommandResult` indicating successful completion of the command will be returned.

Step 8. A list of contacts, if any, will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find contact feature works.

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How find contact feature is implemented:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Extend on the use of the class that implements the `Predicate` interface.
    * Pros: Easily extendable for future enhancements of find command and when more fields are added to contacts. The `Predicate#test` just needs to accommodate one more field.
    * Pros: Less of the codebase needs to be changed.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a generic contact class through the fields provided and match with other contacts to filter.
    * Cons: Difficult to implement / bad runtime and memory usage when multiple values are provided for a single field. e.g. `find n/bob anne` will mean 2 contacts are created with names `bob` and `anne` respectively. Current contacts will then need to be compared with both of these.
    * Cons: Difficult to work with when multiple parameters are provided for multiple fields. e.g. `find n/ann bob t/friend owesMoney` could mean 4 contacts need to be created. One called `ann` with tag `friend` and another with tag `owesMoney`. The same would be required with `bob`.

**Aspect: How to find a contact using ALL search for modules/tags is implemented:**

* **Alternative 1:** Create a `List` of strings from the string provided by the user.
    * Pros: This will reduce the amount of new code we need to write as matching the other fields is implemented in the same way.
    * Cons: Order of input matters for the `List` collection so to check if the user input is a match we may need to loop several times, creating an O(n<sup>2</sup>) solution.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Create a `Set` out of the strings provided by the user.
    * Pros: This will allow us to use set operations such as `equal` and `containsAll` (subset) for `All` search and `retainALL` for intersect. The Java Set is a tried and tested collection which reduced the need for us to create new code for the set operations.

### Proposed enhancements:

**Aspect: How to make find contact more flexible:**

Currently most fields are matched if they contain the full string. Although it is not case-sensitive, searching for contacts does not always need to be an exact match e.g. the user may enter a typo or may not fully remember the desired contact to look for.

* **Alternative 1:** Implement fuzzy search to make a decision based on the "closeness" of the user input and contact's field.
    * Pros: This may accommodate for user typos and reduce constraints, overall improving user experience.
    * Cons: It may be difficult to implement as no one has experience with this algorithm. Furthermore, it may require heavy testing before it can be rolled out.
  

**Aspect: How to make find contact faster:**

Currently most fields are matched using Java's `String#containsWordIgnoreCase`. Upon research this runs in O(nm) where n is the string and m is the substring. This can become very slow as the contact database size increases to very large numbers. 

Moreover, the more filters the find command has, the longer the execution could take.

* **Alternative 1:** Use the trie data structure to store contact information.
    * Pros: This may reduce the runtime of `FindCommand` for each field from O(nm) to O(m).
    * Cons: Implementing the data structure for each field may be difficult and will require a lot of testing.
    * Cons: This may increase the runtime for other operations such as adding contacts.
    * Cons: Implementing the data structure may require restructuring the entire program. This may not be worth the payoff as of now. 
    * Cons: This will increase the memory usage of the program. The balance between runtime and space will have to be considered.

* **Alternative 2:** Use a hashmap to store contact information.
    * Pros: This may reduce the runtime of `FindCommand` for each field from O(nm) to O(maximum(n, m)).
    * Pros: Implementing this may not be very time-consuming.
    * Cons: Testing may become complicated.
    * Cons: This may increase the runtime for other operations such as adding contacts.
    * Cons: Implementing the data structure may require restructuring the entire program. This may not be worth the payoff as of now.
    * Cons: This will increase the memory usage of the program. The balance between runtime and space will have to be considered.

### Sort List Feature

#### Implementation

The proposed sort mechanism is facilitated by `SortCommand`. It extends `Command` which alters the `UniquePersonList`
stored within `AddressBook` to display the list on the UI in a sorted order according to the users specification. The
`Order` class is used to specify the arrangement of the list in either `Order.ASCENDING` or `Order.DESCENDING`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types `sort A-Z n/name` and presses enter.

Step 2. The `sort A-Z n/name` will be parsed by `AddressBook#parseCommand()` which will return a `SortCommandParser` and a `SortPersonListDescriptor`

Step 3. The `FindCommandParser` will parse `A-Z` and `n/name` using `parse()` and then create an `Order` based on `A-Z` and also set the `isSortByName` and
`isSortByModuleCode` attributes of the `SortPersonListDescriptor`.

Step 4. `SortCommandParser` then creates a `SortCommand` by passing the `Order` and `SortPersonListDescriptor` to its constructor.

Step 5. The `SortCommand` will then be executed using `SortCommand#execute()`.

Step 6. The `Model#sort(order, isSortByName, isSortByModuleCode);` method will be called and the list of persons will be sorted according to the `order`, `isSortByName` and `isSortByModuleCode`.

Step 7. A `CommandResult` indicating successful completion of the command will be returned.

Step 8. A list of contacts in a sorted order, if any, will be displayed to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort feature works.

![SortCommandSequenceDiagram](images/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new sort command:

![SortCommandActivityDiagram](images/SortCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to simplify the command for User:**

* **Current Implementation:** Use A-Z to specify ascending to minimise characters and improve ease of understanding
    * Pros: More intuitive
    * Cons: Harder to extend to sorting other items such as rating where A-Z does not make sense to users.

* **Alternative:** Use the word ascending or descending
    * Pros: Easier to generalise to sorting the contact list by other features that has a numerical value.
    * Cons: More letters for user to type.

### Export List Feature

#### Implementation

The proposed export mechanism is facilitated by `ExportCommand`. It extends `Command` which fetches the directory
where the `JSON` copy of the `AddressBook` is stored at. It then uses the `CsvUtils` to create a new CSV file and
parse the `JSON objects` in the file specified and copies it into the new CSV file with a file name specified by user.
`FileName` class is used to specify the name of the file being added to avoid adding a file with an incompatible name.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types `export mycontacts` and presses enter.

Step 2. The `export mycontacts` will be parsed by `AddressBook#parseCommand()` which will return a `ExportCommandParser`.

Step 3. The `ExportCommandParser` will parse `mycontacts` using `parse()` and then create an `FileName`.

Step 4. `ExportCommandParser` then creates a `ExportCommand` by passing the `FileName` to its constructor.

Step 5. The `ExportCommand` will then be executed using `ExportCommand#execute()`.

Step 6. The `Model#getAddressBookFilePath();` method will be called and passed into the fileToExport
parameter of `CsvUtils#exportAsCsv(fileToExport, exportLocation)` along with the `FileName` as the exportLocation parameter.

Step 7. The `CsvUtils#exportAsCsv(fileToExport, exportLocation)` will create a CSV version of the `Addressbook` in the specified `exportLocation`.

Step 8. The `Desktop` will then be used to open the CSV file created.

Step 9. A `CommandResult` indicating successful completion of the command will be returned along with the absolute path of the exported file.

The following sequence diagram shows how the export feature works.

![ExportCommandSequenceDiagram](images/ExportCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to simplify the command for User:**

* **Current Implementation:** Allow users to specify the name of the file they want to store the CSV version of the `addressbook` into.
    * Pros: Allows more customisation for the users.
    * Cons: Might confuse users that are not very familiar with naming files.

* **Alternative:** Use a single word export.
    * Pros: Very intuitive to use and fool-proof.
    * Cons: Users have less customisation.


### Import List Feature

#### Implementation

The proposed import mechanism is facilitated by `ImportCommand`. It extends `Command` which parses the file specified 
by the user in the `import` directory. It uses the `CsvUtils` to scan the CSV file and
parse each row in the file and converts them into `Person` objects. `FileName` class is 
used to specify the name of the file being added to avoid adding a file with an incompatible name.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the export command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user types `import mycontacts.csv` and presses enter.

Step 2. The `import mycontacts` will be parsed by `AddressBook#parseCommand()` which will return a `ImportCommandParser`.

Step 3. The `ImportCommandParser` will parse `mycontacts` using `parse()` and then create an `FileName`.

Step 4. `ImportCommandParser` then creates a `ExportCommand` by passing the `FileName` to its constructor.

Step 5. The `ImportCommand` will then be executed using `ImportCommand#execute()`.

Step 6. The `ImportCommand` retrieves the file located in `FileName` and passed into the fileToImport
parameter of `CsvUtils#importCsv(fileToImport, importLocation)` along with the `FileName` as the importLocation parameter.

Step 7. The `CsvUtils#importCsv(fileToImport, importLocation)` will create a `List<Person>` from the CSV file.

Step 8. The `List<Person>` will then be added to the `AddressBook` and be displayed to the user .

Step 9. A `CommandResult` indicating successful completion.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to simplify the command for User:**

* **Current Implementation:** Allow users to specify the name of the file they want to import.
    * Pros: Allows more customisation for the users.
    * Cons: Might confuse users that are not very familiar with naming files.

* **Alternative:** Create a click-and-drop version where user can simply drop the file they want to import into the GUI.
    * Pros: Very intuitive to use and fool-proof.
    * Cons: Hard to implement and goes against the CLI aspect of the application.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.
</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   1. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### Adding a Student

1. Adding a Student to contact list

    1. Prerequisites: Delete all sample data using the `clear-confirm` command.

    2. Test case: `student n/John Doe m/CS4226 p/98765432 e/JohnD@example.com g/M`<br>
       Expected: New Student contact added to list. Details of the added student contact will be shown in the status message. Pie chart on the right will be updated.

    3. Test case: `student n/Alice m/CS4226 p/91145678 e/alice@example.com`<br>
       Expected: No Student added. Invalid command message shown in the status message.

    4. Other incorrect `student` commands to try: `student n/Alice m/CS4226 p/91145678`, `student n/Alice m/CS4226 e/alice@example.com` (where mandatory fields for student are missing)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

Manual test cases for adding Professors and Teaching Assistants are omitted as they are similar in nature. Refer to [User Guide](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w08-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html) for more information about the commands.

### Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

   2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message. Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

   3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

   4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.

### Opening a person's GitHub Profile Page

1. Opening a person's GitHub Profile Page while all persons are being shown

       Expected: No GitHub Profile page will be opened. Error details shown in the status message.

    4. Test case: `github 2`<br>
       Expected: No GitHub Profile page will be opened. Error details shown in the status message.

    5. Other incorrect GitHub commands to try: `github`, `github x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### Saving data
Note that SoConnect's address book data is stored as a JSON file at [JAR File Location]/data/addressbook.json. Users are able and welcome to update data directly by editing that data file.

#### Dealing with missing/corrupted data files
* If the changes to the data file makes the format of the information invalid, SoConnect will discard all data and start with an empty data file at the next run.
