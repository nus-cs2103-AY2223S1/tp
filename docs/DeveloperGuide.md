### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The architecture diagram given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At App launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `sdel 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="850" />

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StallListPanel`, `ReviewListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFX UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Stall` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `RAddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a review).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("rdel 1")` API call.

<img src="images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png" width="850" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `RDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `RAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `RAddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `RAddCommandParser`, `RDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Stall` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStallList` object) and all `Review` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueReviewList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Stall` and `Review` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Stall>` and `ObservableList<Review>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* maintains its list of `Review` objects to reflect the reviews stored in the `Stall` objects it stores after each operation.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Stall` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Stall` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/foodwhere/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in JSON format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* stores `Review` objects within `Stall` objects for address book data.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `foodwhere.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Review components
* Added classes into the `Model` component to encapsulate a Review

#### Implementation
<img src="images/ModelReviewClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

A `Review`,
- is primarily stored in the Stall associated with it
- is also stored in the `uniqueReviewList` of the Model (reflecting the reviews as stored in the Stall objects after each operation)

A `Review` contains the following attributes,
1. a `Name`, which represent the name of the Stall associated with the Review
1. an `Address`, which represent the address of the Stall associated with the Review
2. a `Date`, which represent the day, month and year as specified in `DD/MM/YYYY`, or any of the specified formats in [here](#file-format-for-foodwhere)
3. a `Content`, which represent the review of the Stall by the user
4. a `Rating`, which represent the rating of the Stall from 0 to 5 inclusive
5. can be assigned to a single `Stall`
6. can be assigned multiple `Tag`s

#### Design considerations:

#### Aspect: How the components within Review are added or changed
- **Current Choice**: Attributes within `Review` are immutable, meaning that if there is an attribute that has to be edited, a new `Review` object has to be created.
    * Pros: Concept of Immutability is met, making the code less prone to bugs as all components of a `Review` object are fixed
    * Cons: Less flexible, more steps needed in editing `Review` objects
- Alternative 1: Allow certain components within `Review`, like `Date` and `Content` to be mutable
    * Pros: Less overhead as fewer objects are created
    * Cons: Prone to error as a Component might not be correctly changed

### Review adding feature

#### What is Review adding feature about?

The add review mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature enhances `AddressBook` by allowing to store not only `Stall`, but also `Review`. This is stored internally as a `UniqueStallList` and `UniqueReviewList`. `Review` requires a `Stall` as `Review` is stored in `Stall`. Additionally, the feature implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#addReview(Review)`â€‰â€”â€‰ Adds the `Review` to `UniqueReviewList`

For the command, the feature extends `Command`, and is implemented as such:
* `radd s/STALL_INDEX d/DATE c/CONTENT r/RATING [t/TAGS]â€¦`

#### Implementation flow of Review adding feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Review adding mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data. Ensure that there is an existing `Stall` with index 1.

Step 2. The user executes `radd s/1 d/20-09-2022 c/The food was good, the chicken rice was fresh. r/4` command to create a new `Review` for `Stall` with index 1.

![AddReview](images/AddReview.png)

#### UML diagram for adding Review

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `radd` command:

<img src="images/AddReviewActivityDiagram.png" width="350" />

#### Design considerations:
- The Review adding commands are straight to the point and efficient for users to add Review for Stall in FoodWhere.
- The prefixes allow users to understand what the different types of data fields Review need in order to be created.

### Finding Stalls and Reviews feature

#### What is finding Stall and Review feature about?

This feature is used to find stalls and reviews in FoodWhere by name and/or by tags. It uses the following two commands:
* `sfind`: Finds stalls
* `rfind`: Finds reviews

`sfind` allows users to find stalls in `AddressBook` by **name**, through matching of input keyword(s) with stall names. Additionally, users can find stalls by **tags**, through matching of input keyword(s) with stall tags.

`rfind` allows users to find reviews in `AddressBook` by **name**, through matching of input keyword(s) with review names. Additionally, users can find reviews by **tags**, through matching of input keyword(s) with review tags.

For the command, the feature extends `Command`, and is implemented as such:
* `sfind n/[NAME_KEYWORDS]â€¦ t/[TAG_KEYWORDS]â€¦`
* `rfind n/[NAME_KEYWORDS]â€¦ t/[TAG_KEYWORDS]â€¦`

#### Implementation flow of finding Stalls and Reviews feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the finding stalls and reviews mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `sfind n/eatery` command to find all stalls where stall name contains the word 'eatery'.

Step 2. The user input will be sent to `SFindCommandParser`.

Step 3. The keyword `eatery` will be parsed as a Name.

Step 4. The parser creates a `StallContainsKeywordsPredicate` using the Name created, while setting the tag attribute to null.

Step 5. The predicate is used to create a new `SFindCommand`.

Step 6. When the SFindCommand executes, the predicate will be sent to ModelManager to filter out stalls that satisfy the predicate.


![AddTodo1](images/sfind.png)

#### UML diagram for finding Stalls/Reviews

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `sfind` or `rfind` command:

<img src="images/FindActivityDiagram.png" width="450" />

#### Design considerations:
- Allow usage of multiple attributes (name and/or tag) as search term to filter out stalls/reviews that have the specified keywords
- Users can enter multiple search keywords to find all relevant stalls/reviews

### Listing all Reviews feature

#### What is listing all Reviews feature about?

The listing of all reviews mechanism is facilitated by `Model`. This feature allows the user to list all reviews.

For the command, the feature extends `Command`, and is implemented as such:
* `rlist`

#### Implementation flow of listing all Reviews feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the listing of all reviews mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `rlist` to list **all** reviews on the FoodWhere user interface.

![ListReview](images/ListReview.png)

#### UML diagram for listing of all Reviews

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `rlist` command:

<img src="images/ListReviewActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

### Review deleting feature

#### What is Review deleting feature about?

The delete review mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. This feature allows the user to delete a review.

For the command, the feature extends `Command`, and is implemented as such:
* `rdel REVIEW_INDEX`

#### Implementation flow of Review deleting feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the listing of all reviews mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user list all the reviews by entering the `rlist` command. Ensure that there is an existing Review with index 2 in the review list.

Step 3. The user executes `rdel 2` command to delete the last review with index 2.

![DeleteReview](images/DeleteReview.png)

#### UML diagram for deleting Review

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `rdel` command:

<img src="images/DeleteReviewActivityDiagram.png" width="350" />

### Review editing feature

#### What is Review editing feature about?

The edit review mechanism is facilitated by `REditCommandParser` and `REditCommand`. This feature allows the user to edit a review after it has been created.

`REditCommandParser.parse()` - parses the user input and returns a `REditCommand` object. `REditCommand.execute()` - creates a new `Review` object based on the parsed user input and calls `Model.setReview()` to replace the old `Review` object with the new `Review` object.

For the command, the feature extends `Command`, and is implemented as such:
* `redit INDEX [d/DATE] [c/CONTENT] [r/RATING] [t/TAGS]â€¦`

#### Implementation flow of Review editing feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the listing of all reviews mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data. Ensure that there is an existing Review with index 2 in the review list.

Step 2. The user executes `redit 2 r/5` command to edit `Review` with index 2 to edit its rating to 5.

Step 3. Since the user input is valid, the `AddressBookParser` will create a `REditCommandParser` to parse the command arguments, `2 r/5`.

Step 4. `REditCommandParser` will parse the index to a `Index` object and parse other arguments as a `EditReviewDescriptor` object. The `Index` and `EditReviewDescriptor` objects will then be passed to the returned `REditCommand` object as its arguments.

Step 5. In `LogicManager`, the returned `REditCommand` is executed.

Step 6. In the execution of the `REditCommand`, a new `Review` object is created. This `Review` consists of the field(s) from the parsed user input, replacing some field(s) of the original `Review` object. In this case, the original `Review` with index 2 is copied over to a new `Review` object except its `Rating` field which is set as `5`.

Step 7. `model.setReview()` will interact with the model to have it replace the immutable `Stall` which contained the original `Review` with a `Stall` containing the updated `Review`.

![EditReview](images/EditReview.png)

![REditSequenceDiagram](images/REditSequenceDiagram.png)

#### UML diagram for editing Review

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `redit` command:

<img src="images/EditReviewActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:
- Multiple fields of a Review can be edited in one go to increase the efficiency of the user of our application.

### Sorting Stalls and Reviews feature

#### What is sorting Stalls and Reviews feature about?

`ssort`: The sort stalls mechanism is facilitated by `Model` and `StallsComparatorList`. This feature allows the user to sort all stalls by specified criterion. The list of supported sorting criteria is stored in `StallsComparatorList` enum class as enum constants. Each enum constant has a `Comparator<Stall>` field that will be passed in as an argument for `Model.sortStalls()` for sorting the stall list.

`rsort`: The sort reviews mechanism is facilitated by `Model` and `ReviewsComparatorList`. This feature allows the user to sort all reviews by specified criterion. The list of supported sorting criteria is stored in `ReviewsComparatorList` enum class as enum constants. Each enum constant has a `Comparator<Review>` field that will be passed in as an argument for `Model.sortReviews()` for sorting the review list.

For the command, the feature extends `Command`, and is implemented as such:
* `ssort CRITERION`
* `rsort CRITERION`

#### Implementation flow of sorting Stalls and Reviews feature

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sorting of all stalls and reviews mechanism behaves at each step.

Note: FoodWhere comes with preloaded data, and can be started on a fresh state with the `clear` command.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. FoodWhere will be initialized with the preloaded data.

Step 2. The user executes `rsort reversedname` command to sort `Review` by name (from Z to A, followed by 9 to 0).

Step 3. Since the user input is valid, the `AddressBookParser` will create a `RSortCommandParser` to parse the command arguments, `reversedname`.

Step 4. `RSortCommandParser` will parse the criterion to a `ReviewsComparatorList` object. The `ReviewsComparatorList` object will then be passed to the returned `RSortCommand` object as its argument.

Step 5. In `LogicManager`, the returned `RSortCommand` is executed.

Step 6. `model.sortReviews()` will interact with the model to sort reviews using the custom comparator that is retrieved from `ReviewsComparatorList.getComparator()`.

![SortReview](images/SortReview.png)

#### UML diagram for sorting Stalls/Reviews

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `ssort` or `rsort` command:

<img src="images/SortActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

### File format for FoodWhere

FoodWhere data is stored as a JSON file.
* The file stores the stalls in the `"stalls"` property of the object
* Each of the stalls is represented by an object with the properties `"name"`, `"address"`, `"tags"`, `"reviews"`.
* The reviews for a stall is stored in the `"reviews"` property of the object representing the stall.
* Each review is represented by an object with the properties `"date"`, `"content"`, `"rating"`, `"tags"`.

Aside from rating, the other fields are stored as strings. The accepted format includes the following:

| Data field     | Format                                                                                                                                                          |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Address        | Any nonempty ASCII text                                                                                                                                         |
| Content        | Any nonempty ASCII text                                                                                                                                         |
| Date           | A date in the format DD/MM/YYYY, D/MM/YYYY, DD/M/YYYY, D/M/YYYY, or with dashes instead of slashes                                                              |
| Name           | Nonempty alphanumeric string with spaces, capitalization preserved, duplicate spaces removed for the actual name                                                |
| Rating         | An integer or floating point number from 0 (inclusive) to 6 (exclusive), rounded down (after interpreted as a floating point number) for the actual rating      |
| Tag            | Alphanumeric token without spaces, interpreted as lowercase for the actual tag                                                                                  |

Below is an example of one stall with one review.
```
{
  "stalls" : [ {
    "name" : "Alex Chicken Rice",
    "address" : "Blk 30 Geylang Street 29, #06-40",
    "tags" : [ "chickenrice" ],
    "reviews" : [ {
      "date" : "20/09/2022",
      "content" : "Very tasty. Worth the trip",
      "rating" : 5,
      "tags" : [ "travelworthy" ]
    } ]
  } ]
}
```


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `sdel 5` command to delete the 5th stall in the address book. The `sdel` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `sdel 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `sadd n/Davids Delights â€¦` to add a new stall. The `sadd` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the stall was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `slist`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `slist`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `sadd n/Davids Delights â€¦` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1:** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `sdel`, just save the stall being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book, but ensuring that Stall and Review are both immutable.
  * Pros: Easy to implement, performance issues for memory are not too bad.
  * Cons: This needs Stall and Review to be guaranteed immutable, alongside all their parts. Good test cases are a must to avoid regressions making them mutable.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Food critics who want to keep track of all the food stalls and reviews given
* have a need to manage a significant number of food stalls and reviews
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefer typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps
* need a local database to store all information

**Value proposition**:

* An application to show all the food stalls and reviews given to the particular stalls
* Commands are typed using command line
* Manage stalls faster than a typical mouse/GUI driven app
* All stalls/reviews created are stored in the local database
