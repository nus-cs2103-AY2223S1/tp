### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of HackAssist.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for:

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of HackAssist consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of HackAssist.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of HackAssist in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagramNew.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and `Task` objects (which are contained in a `TaskList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores the currently 'selected' `Task` objects (e.g., results of a filter query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** With regards to relationship of `Person` object, perhaps an alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-F12-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a task into the taskl ist

#### Motivation
Allows insertion of new task into the tasklist. 

#### Implementation

The insertion mechanism allows a `Task` to be added into the tasklist. A task consists of attributes such as its **name**, **description**, **priority level**, **category**, **deadline** and **email** of person assigned. The command is executed using the `AddTaskCommand`class which extends the `Command` class and the respective attributes of a task is determined from the `AddTaskCommandParser` class which parses the user input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the AddTask mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time, with a tasklist populated with default tasks.

Step 2. The user executes `addTask n/Fix toggle d/Fix dark mode button pr/high c/frontend dl/2022-12-12 pe/charlotte@example.com` to add a task to the tasklist. The `AddTaskCommand` calls the `Model#hasTask()`, checking if the tasklist already contains the task. If the task already exist, an exception will be thrown and a **task already exist** error message will be returned to the user.

Step 3. If the task does not exist in the tasklist and email of person assigned is valid, the `AddTaskCommand` calls the `Model#addTask` to add the task into the tasklist.

Step 4. After making an insert into the tasklist, the `AddTaskCommand` calls the `Model#update`, which calls
`AddressBook#setTasks` to update the tasklist in the model to the latest version.

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddTask operation works:
![AddTaskSequenceDiagram](images/AddTaskCommandUMLDiagram2.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a AddTask command:
![AddTaskActivityDiagram](images/AddTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How addTask executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Assigns a task based on person's email
  * Pros: Person's email is unique. Avoid confusion of task being assigned to two different people with the same email.
  * Cons: Not intuitive.

* **Alternative 2:** Assigns a task based on person's name
  * Pros: Much more intuitive for a task to be assigned to a person name than person email.
  * Cons: This reduces the flexibility of having two person with the same full name.

### Deleting a task from the task list

#### Motivation
Allows removal of task from tasklist based on the index of the task.

#### Implementation

The deletion mechanism allows a `Task` to be deleted from the tasklist based on its index. The command is executed using the `DeleteTaskCommand`class which extends the `Command` class and the index of the task to be deleted is determined from the `DeleteTaskCommandParser` class which parses the user input

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the DeleteTask mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time, with a tasklist populated with default tasks.

Step 2. The user wants to delete the second task on the task list. The user executes `deleteTask 2` to delete the second task from the tasklist. The `DeleteTaskCommand` calls the `Model#getFilteredTaskList()`, and checks if the index of the task to be deleted is within the size of the tasklist. If it is not, an error message containing **invalid index provided**
is displayed to the user.

Step 3. Next, `Model#getFilteredPersonList` is called to obtain the personlist and we check each person to see if the email matches the email of the person the task is assigned to. If it matches, we delete the task from the list of tasks the person is assigned to.

Step 4. After updating all the relevant people assigned to the task, the `DeleteTaskCommand` calls the
`Model#deleteTask` to delete the task from the tasklist.

Step 5. After making a deletion from the tasklist, the `DeleteTaskCommand` calls the `Model#update`, which calls
`AddressBook#setTasks` to update the tasklist in the model to the latest version

The following sequence diagram shows how the DeleteTask operation works:
![DeleteTaskSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteTaskCommandUMLDiagram2.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a DeleteTask command:
![DeleteTaskActivityDiagram](images/DeleteTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How deleteTask executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Deletes task based on index.
  * Pros: O(1) time of deletion as we retrieve from the list based on index.
  * Cons: None

* **Alternative 2:** Deletes task based on taskName.
  itself.
  * Pros: Easier to delete task in the case where we have a lot of tasks, where we do not have to scroll to find the 
  task index.
  * Cons: O(n) time to deletion as we need to search the tasklist based on taskName.

### Edit Task Feature

#### Implementation

When the `editTask` command is entered, an `EditTaskCommand.EditTaskDescriptor` is created which stores the new details to edit the task with. If the inputs are invalid, an exception will be thrown and the corresponding error message will be displayed. If the inputs are valid, then the `model` is updated with the edited task.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an `editTask` command:

![EditTaskCommandActivityDiagram](images/EditTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png)

The sequence diagram is shown below:

![EditTaskCommandSequenceDiagram](images/EditTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Display of person and task list

#### Motivation

Given below is a partial class diagram of the **old UI**.

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="500" height="400" />

In the original implementation, there is only one `PersonListPanel` that displays a list of people using `PersonCard`.
This was sufficent, as the original addressbook only had to manage a list of people.
However, our product needs to display tasks in addition to people, as this is a core feature of our product.

Tasks have a lot of information regarding them, such as deadline, priority, description and category. Thus, including them as
labels within the `PersonCard` would quickly lead to a very messy and disorganized display. Additionally, we intended for each person
to be able to be assigned to multiple tasks. Thus, this would introduce the probelm of having a dynamic number of labels for each
`PersonCard`, and potentially make the UI even more messy,

Therefore, it is necessary to have a **separate list panel** for tasks, as well as people. This would allow the information for tasks to be
cleanly displayed seperate from the information releveant to people

#### Implementation of the new UI

As you can see from the diagrm, the `MainWindow` is filled with both the person and task list
Similar to the person list, the task list will contain all the tasks currently stored in the application
By having separate list panels, it will be easier to display the tasks and people seperately

<img src="images/UiClassDiagramNew.png" />

Each task is given a card, similar to the `PersonCard`, that displays the information regarding the task.
The user can navigate between the dispays using a tab at the top of the UI display.

#### Alternatives considered

We went through several iterations and design alternatives when considering the design of our User Interface

* **Alternative 1 :** Display the people on the Left, and the spotlighted person's task on the right
    * Pros: Able to spotlight a single person's tasks and the details regarding those tasks
    * Cons: Displaying the result of filtering or sorting through all available tasks at once would be very difficult, and confusing for the user

* **Alternative 2:** Display all the people on the Left, and all tasks on the right
    * Pros: Allow the sorting and filtering of tasks to be carried our much easier
    * Cons: Could result in too much information being present, which could overwhelm the user.

### Task and Person display each other

#### Proposed Implementation

Currently, A person in the addressbook has no relation to the tasks assigned to that person. This feature will allow tasks and persons to be related to each other, and allow the UI to display which tasks are assigned to a person, and which person is in charge of a task.

This will be implemented by modifying 3 already existing commands

* `Add`â€‰â€”â€‰Whenever a person is added, any task that shares the same email as the new Person's email wil be updated to reflect the person's name.
* `Delete`â€‰â€”â€‰Whenever a person is deleted, their tasks will be edited to reflect that they are not assigned to any person
* `Edit`â€‰â€”â€‰Whenever a person is edited, their tasks will be edited to reflect the new changes

Given below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2. A new person (John) is added, with an email of test@example.com

Step 3. A new task is added, assigned to John.

Step 4. John is edited to James via the Edit command. This will be reflected in the task that John/James is assigned to

Step 5. James is deleted as a Person. The task is changed to be not assigned to anyone.

### Finding a task by keywords

#### Implementation

The find mechanism allows a `Task` to be identified based on its **name** and **description** attributes. The command is executed using the `FindTaskCommand`, and keyword(s) for the search criteria is determined from the `FindTaskCommandParser` class which parses the user input. A `Predicate<Task>`, an instance of `TaskContainsKeywordsPredicate`, is created and it goes through the tasklist to filter every `Task` based on their **name** and **description** attributes and whether it matches any of the input keyword(s). Keyword matching is case-insensitive. The filtered tasklist is then displayed on the application.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time, with a tasklist populated with default tasks.

Step 2. The user wants to find tasks that have the keyword 'create' in their names and/or descriptions. The user executes `findTask create`. The `FindTaskCommandParser` parses the input keyword and creates an instance of `FindTaskCommand` with 'create' as its `TaskContainsKeywordsPredicate`. This `Predicate<Task>` is passed as an argument into `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task>)`.

Step 3. Next, `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` is called to update the tasklist to display the tasks 'Create UIUX Design' and 'Create Presentation'.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `findTask` command:

![AddTaskActivityDiagram](images/FindTaskCommandActivityDiagram.png)

### Filtering of task by its category, deadline or both

#### Implementation

The filter mechanism allows a `Task` to be filtered based on its **category** and/or **deadline** attributes. The command is executed using the `FilterTaskCommand`, and the filter criteria is determined from the `FilterTaskParser` class which parses the user input. A `Predicate<Task>`, an instance of `TaskCategoryAndDeadlinePredicate`, is created and goes through the tasklist to filter every `Task` based on their **category** and/or **deadline** attributes, depending on if they match the input category and/or are equal to or earlier than the input date respectively. The filtered tasklist is then displayed on the application.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time, with a tasklist populated with default tasks.

Step 2. The user wants to see the tasks that fall under the 'UIUX' category and are due by 2023-01-02. The user executes `filter c/uiux dl/2023-01-02`. The `FilterTaskParser` parses the input arguments and creates an instance of `FilterTaskCommand` with 'UIUX' and '2023-01-02' as the `TaskCategory` and `TaskDate` respectively for its `TaskCategoryAndDeadlinePredicate`. This `Predicate<Task>` is passed as an argument into `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task>)`.

Step 3. Next, `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` is called to update the tasklist to display the task 'Create UIUX Design'.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a `filter` command:

![AddTaskActivityDiagram](images/FilterCommandActivityDiagram.png)


### Redisplay full task list after finding or filtering

#### Implementation

Once done with the filtered tasklist, the user should be able to revert the list to redisplay the original set of tasks. The user executes `listTasks`, creating an instance of `ListTaskCommand` which passes a `model.Model.PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_TASKS` as an argument into `Model#updateFilteredTaskList(Predicate<Task>)`. Finally, `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` is called to update the tasklist to redisplay the original set of tasks unfiltered.

### Sort Tasks Feature

#### Implementation

When the `sort` command is entered, a `Comparator<Task>` is created which will be an instance of either `model.task.SortByDeadline` or `model.task.SortByPriority`. This `Comparator<Task>` will be reversed if the task list needs to be sorted in descending order. The `SortedList<Task>` in the `Model` will then be updated to use the new `Comparator<Task>`.

The sequence diagram is shown below:

![SortTaskCommandSequenceDiagram](images/SortTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

### Email Address in task as reference (foreign key) to person in saved data

#### Motivation

To assign a task to a team person (represented by a `Person` object), we need to save an attribute of the `Person` object in the `JsonAdaptedTask` object that uniquely identifies the person.

#### Implementation

We use a person's email as foreign key as it can uniquely identify a person in our person list. By implementing a foreign key this way, a change in person object is reflected in the task associated to that person. An alternative to this is to keep a person object in a task object but this will prevent the change in the person object that is supposed to be associated with the task object from being displayed in the task as they are two separate objects.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to Relate a Task and a Person in the Saved Data**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Foreign Key Method: Save Person's Email Address in Task Data File.
  * Pros: Changes in person can be cascaded to task.
  * Cons: -.

* **Alternative 2:** Foreign Key Method: Save Person Phone Number in Task Data File.
  * Pros: Changes in person can be cascaded to task.
  * Cons: Compared to email address, phone number is more likely to be identical e.g. people may have the same phone number if they put their home phone number and they live in the same house.

* **Alternative 3:** Save JSonAdaptedPerson in JSonAdaptedTask.
  * Pros: -.
  * Cons: Changes in `person` object are more prone to not be reflected in their associated `task`.

### Persistent storage for task

#### Motivation

For creation of new tasks, deletion of tasks and changes of current tasks to persist over different sessions of using HackAssist (after user close HackAssist and open it again).

#### Implementation

When HackAssist is opened, it will read the data file (AddressBook.json) saved in hard disk in Json format. This data file contains a list of task details (name, description, priority, category, deadline, email of the associated `Person` object (person assigned to this task) and status (done or not done)). Details of each task are read to create a `Task` object which is then added to the running HackAssist's `TaskList`.

An overview of this process is shown below in the form of an activity diagram.

![StorageReadActivityDiagram](images/StorageReadActivityDiagram.png)

When reading Json file we also check whether the values saved are valid before converting it back to a Task object. This is to prevent creating a Task object with illegal values such as an empty name or name like " ". We also check for such illegal values when creating a task through commands. However, they do not prevent creations of task with illegal values that is done by editing Json data file. Thus, the checks when creating Task from Json data file is necessary.

Upon execution of each `Command`, we convert each `Task` object in  `TaskList` to `JsonAdaptedTask` object which is then saved in Json format in hard disk. Each `JsonAdaptedTask` object contains the details of the task.

An overview of this process is shown below in the form of an activity diagram.

![StorageSaveActivityDiagram](images/StorageSaveActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: When to save data?**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the data after execution of each command.
    * Pros: User does not have to remember to save (saved automatically).
    * Cons: More computationally expensive as more save operations are performed.

* **Alternative 2:** Creates a save command and save it when save command is executed.
    * Pros: Less computationally expensive as less save operations are performed.
    * Cons: User may forget to enter save command and lose all of their changes.

* **Alternative 3:** Save when user enters exit command.
    * Pros: Less computationally expensive as less save operations are performed.
    * Cons: User may forget to enter exit command when closing the program and lose all of their changes.

Our current choice of implementation is preferred considering the main use of HackAssist. HackAssist is created mainly for Hackathons where the environment is hectic and stressful and thus, users may tend to forget to save. Moreover, although the computation cost of automatic savings are higher, the difference is not obvious during usage. Thus, we consider the cost of losing saved changes to be worse.

### Persistent storage for people

The motivation, implementation and design considerations are similar to [Persistent Storage for Task](#persistent-storage-for-task)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
