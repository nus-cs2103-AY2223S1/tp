### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `deleteperson John`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

--- 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of the following parts e.g. `CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, `Help Window`, `AssignmentListPanel`, `GroupListPanel`. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it can display `Person`, `Group`, `Assignment` objects residing in the `Model`.

--- 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deleteperson John")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddPersonCommandParser`, `DeletePersonCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

--- 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagramNew.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data:
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
  * all `Group` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGroupList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Group` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as
unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Group>`that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Person** : [`Person.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/person/Person.java)

The `Person` component in relation to `Addressbook` and `UniquePersonList` is given in further detail here.

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Person` component,

* is composed of `Name`, `Phone`, `Email`, `Address` mandatory attributes
* references any number of `Tags` from the `UniqueTagList` in `Addressbook`. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.
* references any number of `Assignments` stored in a `Hashmap<key:String, value:ArrayList<ssignment>>`. This enables keeping track of a `Person`'s assignments under a specific `Group`.

**Group** : [`Group.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/group/Group.java)

The `Group` component in relation to `Addressbook` and `UniqueGroupList` is given in further detail here.

<img src="images/GroupClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Group` component,
* is composed of `GroupName` mandatory attribute
* references any number of `Persons` from the `UniquePersonList` in Addressbook. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Person` object per unique person, instead of each `Group` needing their own `Person` objects.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Assignment** : [`Assignment.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/assignment/Assignment.java)

The `Assignment` component,
* is composed of `Task` mandatory attribute, which is a string description of the `Assignment`.
* is composed of `Workload` mandatory attribute, coded as an enum of `High`, `Medium` or `Low`.
* has an optional `Deadline` attribute which is a `LocalDateTime` object.

--- 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagramNew.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

--- 

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### **\[Developed\] Add/Delete Group feature**

#### **Implementation**
This feature allows groups to be added to and deleted from TABS, facilitated by the `UniqueGroupList`.
It is achieved by the following operations:

- `Model#addGroup(GroupName)` - Adds a group to TABS with the input groupname.
- `Model#deleteGroup(GroupName)` - Deletes the group with the input groupname, and removes any members and assignments associated.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how groups are added/deleted at each stage.

**Step 1.**
The user launches the application for the first time. Presuming they have not made changes to the default persons,
the `AddressBook` model looks like this (some Persons removed for simplicity):

<img src="images/AddDeleteGroupState0.png" width="300" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 2.**
User executes `addgroup g/CS2103T`. This causes a new group with `GroupName` "CS2103T" and no members to be
added to the `AddressBook` model, reflected below:

<img src="images/AddDeleteGroupState1.png" width="300" />

**Note:** The associated parser `AddGroupCommandParser` checks that the entered group name is valid, following same
conventions as naming a `Person`, and the command itself `AddGroupCommand` checks that a group of the same name does
not already exist in the app.

**Step 3.**
Suppose now the user adds `Alice` and `Bob` as members of group CS2103T as shown in [this implementation](#developed-adddelete-member-feature). 
Then, the user assigns `Alice` a task named Task1 under the group CS2103T as demonstrated in [this implementation](#developed-assigndelete-task-feature).
The `AddressBook` model now looks like this:

<img src="images/AddDeleteGroupState2.png" width="300" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 4.**
User executes `deletegroup g/CS2103T`. This deletes the group with `GroupName` "CS2103T" and additionally:
- Removes any members of the group e.g. `Alice` and `Bob` in this instance
- Removes any tasks associated with the group e.g. `Alice`'s task.
The `AddressBook` model now looks like this:

<img src="images/AddDeleteGroupState0.png" width="300" />

**Note:** The associated parser `DeleteGroupCommandParser` checks that the entered group name is valid, following same
conventions as naming a `Person`, and the command itself `DeleteGroupCommand` checks that a group with this name exists
in the app. Below is an activity diagram reflecting this:

<img src="images/DeleteGroupActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

For simplicity, only the `DeleteGroupCommand`'s execution is shown below. Both commands operate via a similar sequence:

<img src="images/DeleteGroupCommandExecutesSequenceDiagram.png" width="400" />

**Design Considerations:**

**Aspect: Data Structure used to store Groups:**
- Alternative 1 (current choice): Reference the `UniquePersonList` in `AddressBook` class
  - Pros:
    - Design is consistent with existing system architecture.
  - Cons:
    - `UniquePersonList` implementation may be unfamiliar.
- Alternative 2: Use simpler data structure e.g. Sets/ArrayList
  - Pros:
    - Can leverage Java libraries, simple to implement.
  - Cons:
    - Design may not be consistent with existing system architecture.
    - Run risk of not accounting for future features, have to design workarounds that weaken the data structure.
    - May violate immutability principle employed in the existing system architecture.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **\[Developed\] Add/Delete member feature**

#### **Implementation**
This feature allows members to be added to and deleted from a group. It is
achieved by the following operations:

- `Model#addMember(Name, GroupName)` - Adds the person with the input name to the group with input groupname.
- `Model#deleteMember(Name, GroupName)` - Removes the person with the input name from the group with the input groupname.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how groups are added/deleted at each stage.

**Step 1.**
Starting from the default persons, the user has executed `addgroup g/CS2103T` to add a group with
`GroupName` "CS2103T". The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState0.png" width="300" />

**Step 2.**
User executes `addmember g/CS2103T n/Alice` to add `Alice` to the
group `CS2103T`. The associated command `AddGroupMemberCommand` first
constructs an `editedPerson` and `editedGroup` to replace `Alice` and
`CS2103T` respectively, before calling `Model#setPerson()` and
`Model#setGroup()` with the respective edits to change `Alice` and
`CS2103T` in the `AddressBook`.
The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState1.png" width="300" />

**Note:** The command itself `AddGroupMemberCommand` checks that both person `Alice` and group
`CS2103T` exist in the app, and that `Alice` is not already a member of `CS2103T`.

**Step 3.**
Suppose the user assigns `Alice` a task under the group. The `AddressBook` model now looks like this:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState2.png" width="300" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 4.**
User executes `deletemember g/CS2103T n/Alice`. This removes `Alice` from `CS2103T` and removes any tasks
associated with the group. The associated command `DeleteGroupMemberCommand` first
constructs an `editedPerson` and `editedGroup` to replace `Alice` and
`CS2103T` respectively, before calling `Model#setPerson()` and
`Model#setGroup()` with the respective edits to change `Alice` and
`CS2103T`.
The `AddressBook` model now looks like this:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState0.png" width="300" />

**Note:** The command itself `DeleteGroupMemberCommand` checks that both person `Alice` and group
`CS2103T` exist in the app, and that `Alice` is a member of `CS2103T` prior to deletion.

For simplicity, only the `DeleteGroupMemberCommand`'s execution is shown below. Both commands operate via a similar sequence:

<img src="images/DeleteGroupMemberCommandExecutesSequenceDiagram.png" width="400" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Design Considerations:**

**Aspect: How a group maintains references to its members:**
- Alternative 1 (current choice): Maintains a reference to a `Person` object.
  - Pros:
    - When deleting group/performing groupwide assignment or deletion of task, easier to retrieve each member to be edited.
  - Cons:
    - Duplication of `Person` in memory, may have performance issues.
- Alternative 2: Maintain a String/`Name` object `Person` only.
  - Pros:
    - No duplication of `Person` in memory, though `Name` object may be duplicated.
  - Cons:
    - When deleting group/performing groupwide assignment or deletion of task, have to lookup the actual `Person` object in AB3 model;
      incur overhead.
- Alternative 3: References to `Group` maintained in a member i.e. the other way around.
  - Pros:
    - No duplication of `Person` in memory.
  - Cons:
    - Deleting group/performing groupwide assignment or deletion of task is even more difficult as
      will have to perform linear scan of the entire `Person` list to surface affected members.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **\[Developed\] Display/List Group feature**

#### **Implementation**
This feature allows a single group to be listed, or displays all groups. It is facilitated
by the following operations:

- `Model#displayGroup(GroupName)` - Finds and lists the group with the input groupname.
- `Model#listGroups()` - Displays all groups in TABS

Given below is an example usage scenario and how groups can be individually displayed/displayed altogether in TABS.

**Step 1.**
Starting from the default persons, the user has executed `addgroup g/CS2103T` to add a group with
`GroupName` "CS2103T".

**Step 2.**
User executes `displaygroup CS2103T`. The associated command `DisplayGroupCommand` calls
`Model#updateFilteredGroupList(predicate)` with the given predicate being the `GroupName` CS2103T
to display just the group with that name.

**Note:**
`DisplayGroupCommand` first checks validity of input against the full group list, obtained as an
`ObservableList<Group>` from `Model#getFilteredGroupList()`. If the input `GroupName` does not correspond
to a group in this list, a `CommandException` will be thrown notifying the user accordingly.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 3.**
User executes `listgroups`. The associated command `ListGroupsCommand` calls
`Model#updateFilteredGroupList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_GROUPS)`to display all groups in the app.

For simplicity, only the `DisplayGroupCommand`'s execution is shown below. Both commands operate via a similar sequence:

<img src="images/DisplayGroupCommandExecutesSequenceDiagram.png" width="400" />

--- 

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **\[Developed\] Assign/Delete Task feature**

#### **Implementation**
This feature allows the user to assign a task to a member, or remove a task from a member. It is facilitated
by the following operations:

- `Model#assignTask(GroupName, Name, Task, Workload, [Deadline])` - Creates an `Assignment` with `Task` (description),
`Workload` and optional `Deadline`. This `Assignment` will be added to the person with the input name, under the group
with the input groupname (a person can hold multiple `Assignments` of the same `Task`, but under different groups).
- `Model#deleteTask(GroupName, Name, Task)`. Deletes the `Assignment` with description `Task` from the person with the input name,
under the group with the input groupname.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how tasks are assigned/deleted at each stage.

**Step 1.**
Starting from the default persons, the user has executed `addgroup g/CS2103T` to add a group with
`GroupName` "CS2103T", then `addmember g/CS2103T n/Alice` to add `Alice` to
the group `CS2103T`. The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState1.png" width="300" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 2.**
User executes `assigntask Alice g/CS2103T task/Task w/High`. This:
- Constructs an Assignment with `Task` "Task" and `Workload` "High".
- Constructs an `editedPerson` to replace `Alice` with a copy which
includes this Assignment, and an `editedGroup` containing the edited
`Alice`.
- Calls `Model#setPerson()` and `Model#setGroup()` with the respective
edits to change `Alice` and `CS2103T` in the `AddressBook`.

The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState2.png" width="300" />

**Note:** `AssignTaskCommandParser` will check if the assignment's parameters are parsed properly,
such as `Task` being non-empty, `Deadline` being a valid date, etc.
`AssignTaskCommand` further checks if both the person and group with the specified name and groupname respectively
exist in the app, that the person is a member of the group, and the person doesn't already have a similar task under
the group.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The user flow of Assign Task can be illustrated in the Activity Diagram as shown below.

<img src="images/AssignTaskActivityDiagram-AssignTaskCommand.png" width="800" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 3.**
User executes `deletetask Alice g/CS2103T task/Task`. This constructs an `editedPerson`
to replace `Alice` with a copy which removes the Assignment whose `Task` matches input,
and an `editedGroup` containing the edited `Alice`. This also calls `Model#setPerson()` and `Model#setGroup()` with the respective
edits to change `Alice` and `CS2103T` in the `AddressBook`.

The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/AddDeleteMemberState2.png" width="300" />

**Note:** `DeleteTaskCommand` checks if both the person and group with the specified name and groupname respectively
exist in the app, that the person is a member of the group, and the person has the specified task under
the group.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For simplicity, only the `DeleteTaskCommand`'s execution is shown below. Both commands operate via a similar sequence:

<img src="images/DeleteTaskCommandExecuteSequenceDiagram.png" width="400" />

**Design Considerations:**

**Aspect: Where task list should be maintained**
- Alternative 1: `Group` object stores a HashMap mapping `Person` to task
  - Pros:
    - Easy to implement
    - Deleting tasks from a `Person` does not require modification of the `Person` object.
  - Cons:
    - If the `Person` is part of multiple groups, retrieving all tasks to display on their card requires referencing multiple `Group` objects.
- Alternative 2 (Current Option): `Person` object stores `Assignments` as a HashMap of `<key:String, value:ArrayList<ssignment>>` where the String is the group name.
  - Pros:
    - Since a `Person` object can be in multiple `Groups`, storing all tasks in `Person` incurs less overhead when all those tasks are displayed in the assignments view.
  - Cons:
    - Deleting tasks from a `Person` requires modification of the `Person` object. This is compounded when multiple `Person`s are updated in one command i.e. bulk commands.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### **\[Developed\] Bulk Assignment & Deletion of Tasks**

#### **Implementation**
This feature allows tasks to be assigned to/deleted from all members of a group simultaneously.
It is facilitated by the following operations:

- `Model#assignTaskAll(GroupName, Task, Workload, [Deadline]` - Creates an `Assignment` with `Task` (description),
  `Workload` and optional `Deadline`. This `Assignment` will be added to all members in the group
  with the input groupname. A member who has the same task name is skipped over.
- `Model#deleteTask(GroupName, Name, Task)`. Deletes the `Assignment` with description `Task` from all members
  in the group with the input groupname. A member who does not have this task is skipped over.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how tasks are assigned/deleted in bulk.

**Step 1.**
Starting from the default persons, the user has executed `addgroup g/CS2103T` to add a group with
`GroupName` "CS2103T", then `addmember g/CS2103T n/Alice`, `addmember g/CS2103T n/Alice` to add `Alice` and `Bob` to
the group `CS2103T`. The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/BulkAssignDeleteTaskState0.png" width="300" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

**Step 2.**
User executes `assigntaskall g/CS2103T task/Task1 w/High`. This:
- Constructs an Assignment with `Task1` "Task" and `Workload` "High".
- For each member `Alice` and `Bob`:
  - Constructs an `editedPerson` to replace the member with a copy which
    includes this Assignment, and an `editedGroup` containing the edited
    member.
  - Calls `Model#setPerson()` and `Model#setGroup()` with the respective
    edits to change member and `CS2103T` in the `AddressBook`.

The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/BulkAssignDeleteTaskState1.png" width="300" />

**Note:** `AssignTaskAllCommandParser` will check if the assignment's parameters are parsed properly,
such as `Task` being non-empty, `Deadline` being a valid date, etc.
`AssignTaskAllCommand` further checks if group with the specified groupname exists in the app. Each member in the group
is handled in a for loop. Members who already have the assignment enter a `continue` block to the next iteration
and are not edited.

**Step 3.**
User executes `deletetaskall g/CS2103T task/Task`. Similar to above:
- For each member `Alice` and `Bob`:
  - Constructs an `editedPerson` to replace the member with a copy which
    removes this Assignment, and an `editedGroup` containing the edited
    member.
  - Calls `Model#setPerson()` and `Model#setGroup()` with the respective
    edits to change member and `CS2103T` in the `AddressBook`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The `AddressBook` model is reflected below:

<img src="images/BulkAssignDeleteTaskState0.png" width="300" />

**Note:** `DeleteTaskAllCommand` checks if group with the specified groupname exists in the app. Each member in the group
is handled in a for loop. Members who do not have the assignment enter a `continue` block to the next iteration
and are not edited.

For simplicity, only the `DeleteTaskAllCommand`'s execution is shown below. Both commands operate via a similar sequence:

**Design Considerations:**

**Aspect: How to handle `Person`s with duplicate task when assigning/no task when deleting:**
- Alternative 1 (Current Option): Person who already has the same task name is skipped over
  - Pros:
    - More user-friendly; if the user does not know that a `Person` already has/does not have the assignment to be added/deleted respectively, the end result is close to the desired outcome.
  - Cons:
    - Have to maintain a list of updated `Person`s to feedback to user; more difficult to implement.
    - The task assigned previously is a different object to the one currently being assigned; can cause memory issues.
- Alternative 2: Return CommandException
  - Pros:
    - Easier to implement.
  - Cons:
    - Less user-friendly; if the user does not keep track of tasks already assigned, cannot take advantage of
      the feature easily.
- Alternative 3: Replace tasks of the same name
  - Pros:
    - More user-friendly; if the user intends to replace the tasks previously assigned, the end result is close to the desired outcome.
    - Since task objects are replaced, no duplication of tasks exists.
  - Cons:
    - In addition to the difficulties mentioned in Alternative 1, must also replace tasks inside a `Person` object; most difficult option to implement.
