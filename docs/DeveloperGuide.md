### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` `TeamListPanel`, `TaskListPanel` , `DisplayUserWindow` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Team` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data. This address book data consists of:
  * all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object),
  * all `Team` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTeamList` object),
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person`, and `Team` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Team>` respectively, that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W09-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.address.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Edit Person Feature

#### Implementation

The edit person feature edits the information of a person in EZLead, this change is reflected within
all teams containing the edited person. The editable information are name, phone number, email address, physical
address and tag.

Given below is an example usage scenario

Step 1. The user wants to change the phone number of a person to 80779043. Said person is indexed number 1 in
the global list. The user executes `edit 1 p/80779043`.

Step 2. The parser will create an `edit` command. This `edit` command will call `Model#getFilteredList()`
to get the `person` specified by the index in the command then create a new `person` with the modified info.
`Model#updateFiltedPersonList` is called to update all teams with the edited members.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit task operation works:
![EditPersonSequenceDiagram](images/EditPersonSequenceDiagram.png)

### Create Team Feature

#### Implementation

The Create Team Feature allows the user to create a team in EZLead. Team will be stored in a global team list

Step 1. The user wants to create a team named Backend. The user executes `create n/Backend`.

Step 2. The parser will create a team object and a `CreateTeam` command containing created team.
The `CreateTeam` command will call `Model#addTeam` to add the team into EZLead.

The following sequence diagram show how the create team operation works:
![CreateTeamSequenceDiagram](images/CreateTeamSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete Team Feature

#### Implementation

The Delete Team Feature allows the user to delete a team in EZLead. After deletion, the team will no longer be reflected in the Graphical User Interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario

Step 1. The user created a team using the `create` command.

Step 2. The user assigns some members into the newly created team using the `assign` command.

Step 3. The user realises that the team has completed their work and is no longer needed, and proceeds to delete the team using the `delteam 1` command (Given that the team created in Step 1 is the team in index 1).

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete team operation works:
![DeleteTeamSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteTeamSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit Team Feature

#### Implementation

The Edit Team Feature allows the user to edit the name of an existing team in EZLead.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Edit Team mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `editteam t/1 n/Team1` to change the name of first team to Team1.

Step 2. The `EditTeam` command is created by the parser using the given team index and new name. It calls
`Model#setTeamName`to change the name of the required team.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit team operation works:
![EditTeamSequenceDiagram](images/EditTeamSequenceDiagram.png)

### Assign Member Feature

#### Implementation

The Assign Member Feature allows the user to assign a person to an existing team in EZLead.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Assign Member mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `assign m/1 t/1` to assign the first person as a member in the first team.

Step 2. The `AssignMember` command is created by the parser using the given member's index (global person index) and
team's index. It calls `Model#addPersonToTeam` to add the person to given team.

The following sequence diagram shows how the assign member operation works:
![AssignMemberSequenceDiagram](images/AssignMemberSequenceDiagram.png)

### Unassign Member Feature

#### Implementation

The Unassign Member Feature allows the user to unassign a person from an existing team in EZLead.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Unassign Member mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `unassign m/1 t/1` to unassign the first person as a member from the first team.

Step 2. The `UnAssignMember` command is created by the parser using the given member's index (global person index) and
team's index. It calls `Model#removePersonFromTeam` to remove the person from given team.

The following sequence diagram shows how the unassign member operation works:
![UnAssignMemberSequenceDiagram](images/UnAssignMemberSequenceDiagram.png)

### Add Task Feature

#### Implementation

The add task feature adds a task into a team and this change is reflected in the Graphical User Interface.
The user may specify a deadline to be associated with the task (i.e. deadline is optional).
The deadline is implemented using `Optional<LocalDate>`. Thus, the deadline can be passed into other methods without knowing whether the deadline exists or not. The `Task` objects are stored in a `UniqueTaskList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1. The user creates the task using the `taskadd` command, executing `taskadd t/1 n/study d/12-12-2022` to add the task "study" to team 1, with 12th December 2022 as the deadline.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add task operation works:
![TaskAddSequenceDiagram](images/TaskAddSequenceDiagram.png)

### Mark Task Feature

#### Implementation

The mark task feature marks a task as completed and this change is reflected in the Graphical User Interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario

Step 1. The user creates the tasks and assign it to a team using the `taskadd` command. The new task created will be initialized with the property isDone to be false.

Step 2. After the task is completed, the user want to mark the task as done. The user then executes `taskmark t/1 task/3` to mark the 3rd task in the 1st team as completed. This would be reflected in the GUI.

Step 3. The user realised that there is some error in the task and wants to unmark it. The user then executes `taskunmark t/1 task/3` to unmark the 3rd task in the 1st team.

The following sequence diagram shows how the mark task operation works:
![TaskMarkSequenceDiagram](images/TaskMarkSequenceDiagram.png)

### Edit Task Feature

#### Implementation

The edit task feature updates the details (can either be name, deadline, or both) of the task to the new details given by the user and this change is reflected in the Graphical User Interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user creates the task and assign it to a team using `taskadd` command. The name of the task provided by the user is stored as Name in the Task class.

Step 2. The user might want to update the name of the task in the future. The user then executes `taskedit t/1 task/1 n/update GUI` to update the name of the task from the previous name to the new name provided by the user. The `taskedit` command will call `Model#getFilteredTeamList()`, which then gets the specified task from the `UniqueTaskList`. The specified task in team 1 would be updated to the new name by keeping all the other task details the same. `Model#updateFilterPersonList` is called to update the team with the new task name and this would be reflected in the gui.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit task operation works:
![TaskEditSequenceDiagram](images/TaskEditSequenceDiagram.png)

### Delete Task Feature

#### Implementation

The delete task feature deletes the task from the specified team given by the user and this change is reflected in the Graphical User Interface.

Given below is an example usage scenario:

Step 1. The user creates the task and assign it to a team using `taskadd` command. The tasks are stored in the UniqueTaskList for each Team.

Step 2. The user might want to delete the task to remove the unwanted task in the future. The user then executes `taskdelete t/1 task/1` to delete the first task from the first team. The `taskdelete` command will call `Model#getFilteredTeamList()`, which then gets the specified task from the `UniqueTaskList`. The specified task in team 1 would be deleted from the taskList. `Model#updateFilterPersonList` is called to update the team with the deletion and this would be reflected in the GUI.

The following sequence diagram shows how delete task operation works:
![TaskDeleteSequenceDiagram](images/TaskDeleteSequenceDiagram.png)
