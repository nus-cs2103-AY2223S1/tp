### 3.1 Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and
[`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#36-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#32-ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#33-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#34-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#35-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.


### 3.2 UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `PersonViewPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder.
For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

The `Graphical UI` that will be displayed to user upon launching `InternConnect` is depicted below.

<img src="images/annotatedGui.png" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.3 Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an applicant).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.4 Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.5 Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)


### 3.6 Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## 4. Implementation Highlights

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.


### 4.1 Checkout Feature

#### Implementation

The checkout mechanism is facilitated by `CheckoutCommand` that extends `Command`. It is supported by `CheckoutCommandParser` and `AddressBookFile`.

It implements the following operations:

* `CheckoutCommand#execute()` â€” Executes the command to switch to a particular list stored in the `data` folder parsed from the `userInput` using `CheckoutCommandParser#parse()`.
* `CheckoutCommand#equals()` â€” Checks whether an instance of a `CheckoutCommand` is equal to another, by checking:
    - Whether they are the same instance
    - Whether the specified list is the same in two different instances

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the checkout mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `Model` and `Storage` will be initialized with the
default list.

![CheckoutState0](images/CheckoutState0.png)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


Step 2. The user executes `checkout june-2022` command to load the JSON `june-2022.json` to the storage.
The `checkout` command calls `CheckoutCommandParser#parse()`, which checks if the user input is valid, which in turn
calls `CheckoutCommand#execute()` if it is valid. If the list does not exist in the `data` folder, the list be created
and populated with sample data. `Model` and `Storage` are then loaded with the specified list and the call returns a
`CommandResult` to `Logic`.

![CheckoutState1](images/CheckoutState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `checkout addressbook` command to load the default JSON `addressbook.json` to the storage.
The `checkout` command calls `CheckoutCommandParser#parse()`, which checks if the user input is valid, which in turn
calls `CheckoutCommand#execute()` if it is valid. If the list does not exist in the `data` folder, the list be created
and populated with sample data. `Model` and `Storage` are then loaded with the specified list and the call returns a
`CommandResult` to `Logic`.

![CheckoutState2](images/CheckoutState2.png)


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


The following sequence diagram shows how the checkout operation works:

![CheckoutSequenceDiagram](images/CheckoutSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a checkout command:

![CheckoutActivityDiagram](images/CheckoutActivityDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How checkout executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Tell the instance of Storage and Model to load the specified AddressBook.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for each AddressBook, just reuse the current instance of Storage and Model).
    * Cons: We must ensure that there are no unintended side effects to the modification of both instances.
      (e.g. Coupling and Dependencies)

* **Alternative 2 (previous choice):** Create a new instance of Storage and Model that loads the specified AddressBook
  and set it to be used by the application.
    * Pros: Faster to switch between AddressBook since they are already loaded into memory.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage because a new instance is created for every
      new AddressBook.


### 4.2 View Feature

#### Implementation

To allow users to view the details of an applicant, a new class `ViewCommand` is added that extends `Command`.

It implements the following operations:

- `ViewCommand#execute()` â€” Executes the command to view a particular applicant in the address book based on the `Index` that was parsed from the user input using the `parse` method of `ViewCommandParser`.
- `ViewCommand#equals()` â€” Checks whether an instance of a `ViewCommand` is equal to another, by checking:
    - Whether they are the same instance
    - Whether the viewed applicant is the same in two different instances

Another `FilteredList<Person>` is created in `ModelManager` to facilitate listening of the viewed applicant. Additionally, `PersonViewPanel.java`, `PersonViewCard.java`, and their respective `.fxml` files are also created.

To view the details of an applicant, the user can run the `view` command from the command box. The input is parsed and handled by the following classes:

- `AddressBookParser`, that parses the input and checks whether it contains the word `view`, which then proceeds to call `ViewCommandParser#parse()`.
- `ViewCommandParser`, that parses the input to create `Index` of the applicant to be viewed, and returns a `ViewCommand` to be executed by the `LogicManager`.
    - If the index provided is invalid (e.g. more than that of the displayed list), it will be handled by `ViewCommand` upon execution.

Given below is an example success scenario and how the `view` mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes `view INDEX`
1. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(userInput)`
1. `LogicManager` calls `ViewCommand#execute(model, storage)`
1. `ViewCommand` retrieves currently displayed list from `Model` by calling `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`
1. `ViewCommand` creates a new `personToView` by retrieving the applicant at the current `Index`
1. `ViewCommand` creates a new `SamePersonPredicate` to check if the `Person` to be viewed is the same as `personToView`
1. `ViewCommand` updates the `FilteredList<Person>` in `Model` to reflect `personToView` by evaluating the `SamePersonPredicate`
1. A `CommandResult` object indicating that the `view` is successful will be created

The following sequence diagram shows how the `view` command works:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ViewCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How the UI window is split to show a panel of list of all applicants and another panel to view details of an applicant:**

- **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Window is split into half below the result display box.
    - Pros: Symmetrical and looks more regular.
    - Cons: Pane to view details of an applicant is smaller.
![guiDesignConsideration1](images/guiDesignConsideration1.png)
- **Alternative 2:** Window is split from the top, so both command box and result display box are halved.
    - Pros: Can have a larger pane to view details of an applicant.
    - Cons: Need to scroll more to see typed command and result displayed.
![guiDesignConsideration2](images/guiDesignConsideration2.png)


### 4.3 Import Feature

The `import` feature allows the user to append their list with another list imported from an external JSON file, instead of asking them to write the applicants one by one into the command line.

#### Implementation

The import feature is done through a `ImportCommand` that extends `Command`. It is supported by `ImportCommandParser`
and `JsonAddressBookStorage`.

Given below is an example success scenario and how the `import` mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes `import fileName.json`.
2. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(userInput)`.
3. `LogicManager` calls `ImportCommand#execute(model, storage)`.
4. `ImportCommand` creates a`JsonAddressBookStorage` object using the specified file, and calls
   `JsonAddressBookStorage#readAddressBook()` to create the `AddressBook` that is going to be appended.
5. `ImportCommand` then calls `Model#appendAddressBook(toAppend)` to append it to the original list.
6. A `CommandResult` object indicating that the `import` command is successful will be created.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `import` command works:

![ImportSequenceDiagram](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ImportCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: What format should the imported file be**
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation)**: We use the current `addressbook.json` format.
    * Pros:
        * Same format as the data file, meaning 1 less format to remember.
        * Can be read with current methods.
        * Consistent file formatting across the app's files.
    * Cons:
        * It may take some time for user to get used to the format.
* **Alternative 2**: We use a txt file with a new format
    * Pros:
        * The format may be easier to remember, as it does not have JSON file restrictions.
    * Cons:
        * We need to implement new methods to read the txt file.
        * The format is not consistent with the rest of the app's files.


### 4.4 Export Feature

The `export` feature allows the user to export the displayed list in InternConnect to a JSON file.

#### Implementation

`exportCommand` class is used in the execution of `export` command.
`Storage#exportDisplayedListAddressBook(displayedListAddressBook, filePath)` is called to save the JSON file in `data/export/` folder.

Given below is an example success scenario and how the `export` mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes `export`
2. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(userInput)`
3. `LogicManager` calls `ExportCommand#execute(model, storage)`
4. `ExportCommand` gets current `DateTime` and use it for the output JSON file name
5. `ExportCommand` retrieves the `displayedList` from `model` by calling `Model#getFilteredPersonList()`
6. `ExportCommand` calls `Storage#exportDisplayedListAddressBook(displayedListAddressBook, filePath)`
7. The displayed list is stored as a JSON file in `data/export/<currentDateTime>.json`
8. A `CommandResult` object indicating that the `export` command is successful will be created

The following sequence diagram shows how the `export` command works:

![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Where to save the exported JSON file**
* **Alternative 1 (current implementation)**: We save the files in the `data/export/` folder and
  use `<currentDateTime>.json` as the file name.
    * Pros:
        * Location for all exported JSON files is in a single folder.
        * Naming format for all exported JSON files is fixed.
    * Cons:
        * Users will not be able to save the files where they like.
        * Users will be able to name the JSON file as they wish.
* **Alternative 2**: User specifies where to save the JSON file and what to name the file.
    * Pros:
        * Users will be able to save the JSON file where they like.
        * Users will be able to name the JSON file as they wish.
    * Cons:
        * Harder to implement since there will be a lot of cases to cover, e.g. if the specified path is not
          in JSON format or not a valid file path or file already exists etc.
        * Quite messy since the users can specify a completely different file path/directory everytime they
          execute `export` command.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

* **Alternative 3**: We save the files in the `data/export/` folder and user specifies only the file name.
    * Pros:
        * Location for all exported JSON files is in a single folder.
        * Users will be able to name the JSON file as they wish.
    * Cons:
        * Harder to implement since there will be a lot of cases to cover, e.g. if the specified file name is not
          in JSON format or file already exists etc.
        * Users will not be able to save the files where they like.


### 4.5 Find Feature Improvements

The `find` feature currently allows the user to search by name among all applicants in store by InternConnect. We want to improve onto this feature to allow Users to search by any possible field of choice

#### Implementation

Currently, the `findCommand` class is used in the execution of `find` command. The command is then parsed accordingly, with a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` as an argument to the command. We now want to extend this with 2 changes:

1. Add a predicate for each appropriate attribute
2. Modify the Parser to appropriately choose the predicates based on a set syntax for its arguments
3. Modify the `FindCommand` to take in the list of chosen predicates instead of a single predicate
4. Combine the predicates into a single predicate to filter the displayed list by

Given below is an example success scenario and how the `find` mechanism behaves at each step.

1. The user executes `find`.
2. `LogicManager` calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand(userInput)`.
3. `AddressBookParser` calls `FindCommandParser#parse(userInput)`.
4. `FindCommandParser` parses the arguments and creates a find command with its associated list of predicates to search by
5. `LogicManager` calls `FindCommand#execute(model, storage)`.
6. `FindCommand` combines the list of predicates into a single predicate, and calls `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(predicate)`.
7. `FindCommand` updates the `displayedList` from `model` to display only the Applicants that match the predicate.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>


The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` command works:

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommandParser`
should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Dealing with multiple predicates**
* **Alternative 1 (Current Implementation)**: Combines all the predicates into a single predicate
    * Pros:
        * Consistent with the current implementation of `find`, which uses a single predicate
        * Creation of specific predicate for each field type, allows for customization of each field's search implementation
        * Can combine the predicates by _OR_ or _AND_ search as the developer intends for
        * Modular design reduces coupling, and allows for easy extension and testing of the `find` command
    * Cons:
        * Requires creation of predicate for each field type, can be tedious to implement and test
        * Requires the developer to decide how to combine the predicates and to decide the search type for each field, which reduces customizability of the search query for the user.
* **Alternative 2**: Empower user to create predicates themselves, and how they want to combine and search the list with their created predicates
  * Pros:
    * Allows for greater customizability of the search query for the user
    * Allows for greater flexibility of the search query for the user
  * Cons:
    * Unintuitive for a first time user to use. Requires the user to know the syntax creating a predicate, and requires the user to know how to combine predicates as they intend for which can be tedious to learn
    * Security of program will go down, as we allow user to input functions that will be evaluated by the program. Malicious input may be able to compromise the program.


**Aspect: Different search types**
* **Alternative 1**: we create a new command for each type of search
    * Pros:
        * All commands current follow this design, allows for consistency in code structure, and follows current OOP design conventions.
        * Naming format for all commands are fixed.
    * Cons:
        * Users will expect the `find` command to be under the same category/usage scenario as a `findAll` command and a `findSubstring` command
* **Alternative 2**: flag is used within the find command to allow usage to select the type of search they want to perform
    * Pros:
        * Users who are already familiar with the `find` command can extend further its power and functionality with flags without "relearning" a new syntax for a different command.
        * Users will find it intuitive that a `find` command is the main overlying command, and within its syntax they can change the way its used, similar to how current CLI commands are implemented
        * Future commands which want to use flags can build onto the newly restructured code
    * Cons:
        * Harder to implement since a flag is a brand-new functionality which other commands do not have. Coupled classes have to be modified accordingly, such as the relevant parser classes and argumentTokenizer/Multimap
        * Flags introduce the possibility for more input types to consider, and these affects the inputs that users can use in all commands
        * Requires restructuring old code, which will increase testing time and possibility of introducing bugs into existing code
*  **Alternative 3 (_current implementation_)**: Choose a search type for each field type
    * Pros:
        * Allow for multiple field searches where the search within each field is curated to best search the available field values
        * Intuitive and easy for Users to use
        * Less syntax and user input required in comparison to _alternative 2_
    * Cons:
        * Search type for the field may not be how the User wants to search
