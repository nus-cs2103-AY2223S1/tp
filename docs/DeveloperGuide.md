### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `HealthcareXpressParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `HealthcareXpressParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `HealthcareXpressParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

The `Model` component,

- stores healthcareXpress data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

A diagram of the `Person` class is shown below, for better understanding of the attributes and relations of the different types.

<img src="images/PersonClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F13-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Unique ID Mechanism

#### Motivation:

Individuals who are modelled by the subclasses of `Person` may have very similar attributes, such as name, gender and tags. As such there is a high chance that the medical administrator may be confused when looking at similar persons. Thus, a unique id (UID) was introduced to act as the differentiator for such persons.

#### Implementation for unique ID:

The unique ID mechanism is facilitated by the `Uid` class. The `Uid` instance utilizes the `AtomicLong` class and ensures that unique `Uid` are used throughout the system.

Originally there was a `UidManager` class which facilitated the generation and implementation of ensuring that there is no repeated `Uid` objects. However, this was later refactored to utilize the `AtomicLong` class.

### Add feature

#### Implementation for adding a patient:

The add patient mechanism is facilitated by `Patient`, `AddCommandParser`,`AddCommand`, `Model`, `AddressBook` and `UniquePersonList`.

`Patient` extends from `Person`. A `Patient` has the `Person` attributes and a `dateSlotList`. This is shown in the diagram below:

![PatientClassDiagram](images/PatientClassDiagram.png)

The `AddCommandParser` takes in user input, extracts information and creates a `Patient`.

The `AddCommand` will then be executed, adding the `Patient` to the `Model`'s `AddressBook`'s `UniquePersonList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add patient mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user executes `add c/P n/Lily g/F p/91103813 a/ABC STREET 111 e/lily@gmail.com t/heartDisease ds/2022-10-10,3` command to add a new patient that requires nurse's home-visit.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `c/P` is needed to indicate that the person added is a patient.`Name`, `Gender`, `Phone`, `Address`, `Email` is compulsory but `Tag` and `DateTime` has been made optional. The `n/`, `g/`, `p/` ... are the prefixes used to extract different details' field of the patient.

</div>

Step 2. The `HealthcareXpressParser` will parse the user command to return an `AddCommandParser` with the patient's details.

Step 3. The `AddCommandParser` will parse the respective patient's details using fixed prefixes and check their validity. The `Uid` for the patient will also be generated and used along with the parsed patient's details to create a patient if all the inputs are valid. Then, it returns an `AddCommand` with the patient created.

Step 4. The `AddCommand` will be executed and the patient will be added to the `Model`'s `AddressBook`'s `UniquePersonList`. In the `UniquePersonList`, potential duplication will be checked.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add patient operation works:

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** For simplification purpose, `c/P n/Lily g/F p/91103813 a/ABC STREET 111 e/lily@gmail.com t/heartDisease ds/2022-10-10,3` will be written as userInput and all the parsed patient's details will be written as patientDetails.

</div>

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 5. The `LogicManager` will then call `saveAddressBook()` to store the new updated `AddressBook` so that the data of the new patient can be retrieved later.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add patient command:

![AddPatientActivityDiagram](images/AddPatientActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to deal with duplication:**

- **Alternative 1:** Check the name. If the name is the same, then show duplicate error and do not proceed to add the patient.

  - Pros: Easy to implement.
  - Cons: If the 2 different patients have the exact same name, the user would not be able to add that patient.

- **Alternative 2:** Check the name. If the name is the same, then show duplicate warning but that patient would still be added.

  - Pros: If the 2 different patients have the exact same name, the user would still be able to add that patient. At the same time, it will show potential duplication to the user.
  - Cons: The user have to manually check whether it is the same person and delete it if it is a duplication.
  - Cons: The user might miss out the duplicated patients.

- **Alternative 3 (Chosen):** Check the similarity levels by comparing attributes of both people. If there is only a zero or one field difference between the two, then show duplicate warning but that patient would still be added
  - Pros: By comparing similarity levels, it reduces the chances of actually having a duplicate, which means that if the warning appears then there is a high chance that it is an actual duplicate, not a false duplicate with only same name.
  - Cons: The user would still have to manually delete if it is a duplicate.

**Aspect: The home-visit `DateTime` input:**

- **Alternative 1:** The `DateTime` input is in the format of `YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm` and it can in any time.

  - Pros: More specific date and time recorded for the patient.
  - Pros: More flexible in the home visit date and time that a patient can choose.
  - Cons: It is hard to determine/check time crashes when assigning a home-visit `DateTime` to a nurse.

- **Alternative 2 (Chosen):** The `DateTime` input will be in the format of `YYYY-MM-DD` and slot. The slot will have fixed starting time and fixed duration.
  - Pros: It is easy to determine/check time crashes when assigning a home-visit `DateTime` slot to a nurse.
  - Cons: Less flexible in the home visit date and time that a patient can choose.

### Unmark feature

#### Implementation for unmarking home visits between Nurses and Patients

The unmarking mechanism is facilitated by `Patient`, `Nurse`, `UnmarkCommandParser`, `UnmarkCommand`, `Model`, `AddressBook`, and `UniquePersonList`.

The `HealthcareXpressParser` will take in user input and recognise it as an `UnmarkCommand`, and pass on the user input to `UnmarkCommandParser`.

`UnmarkCommandParser` will then identify the Patient of interest, by parsing the uid provided by the user.

`UnmarkCommandParser` will also identify the dateslot index given by the user.

`UnmarkCommandParser` returns an `UnmarkCommand`.

Upon execution, the `UnmarkCommand` will check if the uid refers to a valid patient. If so, it will unmark the dateslot at the specified dateslot index.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the unmark mechanism works.

Step 1. The user enters the command `unmark id/1 dsi/1` command to unmark the home visit at dateslot index 1, of the Patient with uid of 1.

Step 2. The `HealthcareXpressParser` will parse the user command and pass the input to the `UnmarkCommandParser`

Step 3. The `UnmarkCommandParser` will parse the uid and dateslot index, and ensure that both are present. It will then return an `UnmarkCommand` with the uid and dateslot index.

Step 4. The `UnmarkCommand` will execute, creating an `InternalEditor` to update the dateslot list of the patient with the dateslot at the specified dateslot index unmarked.

The following sequence diagram shows how unmarking a dateslot works:

![UnmarkSequenceDiagram](images/UnmarkSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user unmarks a dateslot.

![UnmarkActivityDiagram](images/UnmarkActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

** Aspect: Unmarking DateSlots that have not been marked: **

- **Alternative 1:** Print and error message to inform the user that the dateslot has not been marked.
  - Pros: User will be made aware that they have probably erroneously unmarked the wrong dateslot, and make the necessary correction.
  - Cons: More difficult to implement, requires more thorough testing.

- **Alternative 2:** Make no changes and raise no exceptions.
  - Pros: Easier to implement and test.
  - Cons: User may have erroneously unmarked the wrong dateslot, and may not notice.

### Undounmark feature

#### Implementation for remarking dateslots of Patients

The undo unmarking mechanism is facilitated by `Patient`, `Nurse`, `UndoUnmarkCommandParser`, `UndoUnmarkCommand`, `Model`, `AddressBook`, and `UniquePersonList`.

The `HealthcareXpressParser` will take in user input and recognise it as an `UndoUnmarkCommand`, and pass on the user input to `UndoUnmarkCommandParser`.

`UndoUnmarkCommandParser` will then identify the Patient of interest, by parsing the uid provided by the user.

`UndoUnmarkCommandParser` will also identify the dateslot index given by the user.

`UndoUnmarkCommandParser` returns an `UndoUnmarkCommand`.

Upon execution, the `UndoUnmarkCommand` will check if the uid refers to a valid patient. If so, it will check if the dateslot at the specified dateslot is currently marked. If it is unmarked, it will undo the unmarking.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo unmark mechanism works.

Step 1. The user enters the command `undounmark id/1 dsi/1` command to undo the unmarking of the dateslot at index 1 of the dateslot list of the Patient with uid of 1.

Step 2. The `HealthcareXpressParser` will parse the user command and pass the input to the `UndoUnmarkCommandParser`

Step 3. The `UndoUnmarkCommandParser` will parse the uid and dateslot index, and ensure that both are present. It will then return an `UndoUnmarkCommand` with the uid and dateslot index.

Step 4. The `UndoUnmarkCommand` will execute, creating an `InternalEditor` to update the dateslot list of the patient with the dateslot at the specified dateslot index marked.

The following sequence diagram shows how undoing an unmarking works:

![UndoUnmarkSequenceDiagram](images/UndoUnmarkSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram shows what happens when a user undos an unmark.

![UndoUnmarkActivityDiagram](images/UndoUnmarkActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

** Aspect: Undo unmarking DateSlots that have already been marked: **

- **Alternative 1 (chosen):** Print an error message to inform the user that the dateslot has been marked.
  - Pros: User will be made aware that they have probably erroneously marked the wrong dateslot, and make the necessary correction.
  - Cons: More difficult to implement, requires more thorough testing.

- **Alternative 2:** Make no changes and raise no exceptions.
  - Pros: Easier to implement and test.
  - Cons: User may have erroneously marked the wrong dateslot, and may not notice.


### List feature

#### Implementation for listing patients and nurses based on specified criteria

The list user function is primarily facilitated by `ListCommandParser`,`ListCommand`. `Model` and `Person` are also involved.

`ListCommandParser` takes in user input and extracts the specified criteria that the user wants.

The criteria are then passed to `ListCommand` which will create a `Predicate` based on the given criteria.

This `Predicate` is passed to `Model`, which will filter and display the enrolled users who match the given criteria.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the list function behaves at each step. It is illustrated with the following sequence diagram:

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user executes `list c/n g/f` to list all female nurses.

Step 2. `HealthcareXpressParser` parses the user command to return a `ListCommandParser` with the given criteria.

Step 3. The `ListCommandParser` parses the criteria using fixed prefixes and check their validity. Then, it returns an `ListCommand` with the criteria `category=N, gender=F`.

Step 4. The `ListCommand` will be executed and a `Predicate` of `category=N, gender=F` is created and passed to `Model`.

Step 5. `Model` applies the `Predicate` and filters the list of enrolled users, displaying all female nurses only.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the list command:

![ListActivityDiagram](images/ListActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: Dealing with one invalid input amoung multiple valid inputs:**

- **Alternative 1 (Chosen):** Verify validity of all inputs. If an input is invalid, ignore it and list based on the other given inputs, giving a user warning.

  - Pros: It might be more convenient for the user in certain circumstances where exact criteria matching is not vital.
  - Cons: The user might think that the returned list fits the given criteria exactly, which might lead to user errors.

- **Alternative 2:** Verify validity of all inputs. If an input is invalid, do not process the command.
  - Pros: If a list is returned then the user can be sure that all returned users match the given criteria exactly.
  - Cons: Possibly inefficient if exact matching is not vital.

### Update Emergency Contacts feature

#### Implementation for updating attending physician and next of kin contact information for patients:

The feature is primarily facilitated by `UpdateContactCommand` and `UpdateContactCommandParser`.

`UpdateContactCommandParser` takes in user input, extracts contact info and passes it to `UpdateContactCommand`.

`UpdateContactCommand` creates a new `NextOfKin` or `Physician`, based on whichever one the user specified.

The new `NextOfKin` or `Physician` will have the contact details as stated by the user.

`UpdateContactCommand` then gets the `Patient` from the database and edits the `Patient` to include the new contact.

The new `Patient`, with the contact info, is then passed to `Model`, so that the details are saved in the database.

Given below is an example scenario and how the `UpdateContactCommand` behaves at each step,
illustrated with the following sequence diagram:

![UpdateContactSequenceDiagram](images/UpdateContactSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user executes `updatecontact id/3 n/ John Doe p/ 81234567 e/ johndoe@example.com c/ D`

Step 2. `HealthcareXpressParser` creates an `UpdateContactCommandParser` to parse the arguments.

Step 3. `UpdateContactCommandParser` checks validity of the given arguments and creates an `UpdateContactCommand`.

Step 4. The `UpdateContactCommand` is executed, and a new `Physician` with the given contact info is created`.

Step 5. `UpdateContactCommand` gets `Patient` with UID 3 from the database, and updates the `Patient` to contain
`Physician` John Doe.

Step 6. `Model` updates the database, and displays the attending physician on `Patient` UID 3.

The activity diagram below summarises exception handling of UpdateContactCommand:

![UpdateContactActivityDiagram](images/UpdateContactActivityDiagram.png)

### Assign Feature

#### Motivation:

- The assign feature is necessary so that the medical administrator can visually see which nurse is attending which patient's home visit.

#### Implementation:

![AssignSequenceDiagram](images/AssignSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user executes `assign id/3 id/2`

Step 2. `HealthcareXpressParser` creates an `AssignCommandParser` to parse the arguments.

Step 3. `AssignCommandParser` checks validity of the given arguments and creates an `AssignCommand`.

Step 4. The `AssignCommand` is executed, and a new `InternalEditor` is created.

Step 5. `AssignCommand` calls the `InternalEditor`'s methods of `editPatient` and `editNurse`.

Step 6. `Model` updates the database, and displays all the persons.

The activity diagram below summarises exception handling of AssignCommand:

![AssignActivityDiagram](images/AssignActivityDiagram.png)
<br>

#### Design considerations:

- **Aspect: How the parse interprets the order of uids**
  - **Alternative 1:** Fix the order of the uid, so patient then nurse
    - Pros: There will be less checking needed to deduce the class of the persons involved.
    - Cons: The user experience will suffer as the medical administrator might not be able to accurately remember which uid corresponding to which person, the nurse or the patient.
      <br>
  - **Alternative 2:** Have no fix order, as long as one nurse uid and one patient uid is inputted
    - Pros: The user experience will be better as there will be more leeway.
    - Cons: Harder to implement and more testing is required.
      <br>

### Deassign Feature

#### Motivation:

- The deassign feature is necessary so that the medical administrator deassign a nurse to a patient's home visit if a mistake has been made or changes are necessary.

#### Implementation:
Step 1. The user executes `deassign id/3`

Step 2. `HealthcareXpressParser` creates an `DeassignCommandParser` to parse the arguments.

Step 3. `DeassignCommandParser` checks validity of the given arguments and creates an `DeassignCommand`.

Step 4. The `DeassignCommand` is executed, the person with the id of 3 will have their home visits deassigned.

Step 5. `Model` updates the database, and displays all the persons.
