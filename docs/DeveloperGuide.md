ModQuik is a convenient tool that allows Teaching Assistants (TAs) to keep track of their classes, monitor their students' grades and set up reminders for their tasks (such as creating tutorial slides or marking homework).
ModQuik is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
ModQuik can get one's lesson management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps if one is a fast typist.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/modquik/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/modquik/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete student 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="600" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modquik/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modquik/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`, `Reminder`, `Tutorial`, `Consultation` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modquik/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ModQuikParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete student 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete student 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ModQuikParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `ModQuikParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/modquik/model/Model.java)

![ModelClassDiagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

**Student component:**

![StudentClassDiagram](images/StudentClassDiagram.png)

**Consultation component:**

![ConsultationClassDiagram](images/ConsultationClassDiagram.png)

**Reminder component:**

![ReminderClassDiagram](images/ReminderClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the mod quik data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object), `Tutorial`, `Consultation`, `Reminder` objects
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/modquik/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="1000" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both ModQuik data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ModQuikStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.modquik.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **5. Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Student Feature

This feature allows a TA to add a student to the student list.

#### Current Implementation

The implementation of the `add student` command involves creating new Student objects and storing them in the modquik.json using the JsonAdaptedStudent class.

The add student command has the following fields:

* n/ prefix followed by the name of the student
* i/ prefix followed by the student id
* ph/ prefix followed by the student's phone number
* e/ prefix followed by the student's email
* tele/ prefix followed by the student's telegram handle
* m/ prefix followed by the module code
* tut/ prefix followed by the tutorial name
* g/ prefix followed by the student's grade (Optional)
* att/ prefix followed by the student's attendance score (Optional)
* part/ prefix followed by the student's participation score (Optional)
* t/ prefix followed by relevant tags (Optional)

The system will validate the parameters supplied by the user. When input validation fails, error message specifying the first identified error will be shown to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add student` command works:

![AddStudentSequenceDiagram](images/AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
`add tutorial`, `add consultation` and `add reminder` commands work similar to the above but have different fields.
</div>

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when the `add student` command is executed. ModQuik will check if the given student id does not already exist.

![AddStudentActivityDiagram](images/AddStudentActivityDiagram.png)

**NOTE:** Fields used in `add student` command are name, student id, phone, email, telegram handle, module, tutorial, and grade(if any), attendance(if any), participation (if any), tags (if any).

Referencing the above activity diagram, ModQuik will first check that all prefixes are present and formatted correctly. It will then proceed to check if all fields provided are formatted correctly. After that, it creates a Student object using the provided fields and then check if there is a duplicate student inside ModQuik. If there are no duplicate student inside ModQuik, it will check across every student in ModQuik to see if the provided student id already exists inside ModQuik. If the provided student id does not belong to any student inside ModQuik already, the created student is then added into ModQuik and a message is returned indicating success. The new student will appear in the ModQuik.


### Edit Student Feature

This feature allows a TA to edit a student in the displayed student list.

#### Current Implementation

The implementation of the `edit student` command involves creating new Student objects and replacing the previous Student object to be edited as identified by the user.

The edit student command has the following fields. All fields are optional but at least one must be provided:

* n/ prefix followed by the name of the student
* i/ prefix followed by the student id
* ph/ prefix followed by the student's phone number
* e/ prefix followed by the student's email
* tele/ prefix followed by the student's telegram handle
* m/ prefix followed by the module code
* tut/ prefix followed by the tutorial name
* g/ prefix followed by the student's grade
* att/ prefix followed by the student's attendance score
* part/ prefix followed by the student's participation score
* t/ prefix followed by relevant tags

The system will validate the parameters supplied by the user. When input validation fails, error message specifying the first identified error will be shown to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `edit student` command works:

![EditStudentSequenceDiagram](images/EditStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
`edit tutorial`, `edit consultation` and `edit reminder` commands work similar to the above but have different fields.
</div>

### Delete Student Feature

This feature allows a TA to delete a student in the displayd student list.

#### Current Implementation

The implementation of the `delete student` command involves deleting the Student object identified by the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `delete student` command works:

![DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when the `delete student` command is executed.
![DeleteStudentActivityDiagram](images/DeleteStudentActivityDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:**
`delete tutorial`, `delete consultation` and `delete reminder` commands work similar to the above.
</div>

### Find Student Feature

The implementation of the `find` command to find students, allows the user to see a filtered list of students.
The filtering is based on an AND search, for example, `find n/John m/CS2103T` will show only students that have "John" in their name and are also from the CS2103T module.

#### Implementation
The filtering logic is done with predicate classes that implement Java's Predicate interface.
![FindPredicateClassDiagram](images/FindPredicateClassDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagrams shows how the `find` command works.
![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)
![FindSequenceDiagramRef](images/FindSequenceDiagramRef.png)

When a user enters `find n/John m/CS2103T`, the FindCommandParser created will parse the tags in the command.
For each valid tag, it creates the respective XYZPredicate. In the example command, there are two search criteria
corresponding to name and module, hence a `NamePredicate` and a `ModulePredicate` is created.

These predicates are stored in a `List`, which is passed to the `createChainedPredicates` internal method that combines the predicates in the AND sense.
The resulting predicate is a `Predicate<Student>`, and the call to its constructor is not shown in the diagram for brevity.
The predicate, henceforth referred as `predC`, is stored passed to `FindCommand` constructor.

When the `FindCommand` is executed, it calls the updates the model using `predC`. Hence, the model's student list
now only contains selected students.

### Grade Chart Feature

This feature allows a TA to navigate to view the grade chart of students without the use of a mouse. This is crucial as our target users are fast typists who prefer typing to other means of input.

#### Current Implementation

The following sequence diagram shows how the show grade command works.

![ShowGradeSequenceDiagram](images/ShowGradeSequenceDiagram.png)

The `SwitchCommand#execute()` returns the `CommandResult(MESSAGE_SUCCESS_GRADE, GRADE_CHART)` that is returned to `LogicManager` and passed to `MainWindow`. The `MainWindow` then calls `handleShowChart()` which calls `ModelManager#getStudentGradeChartData()` to get the data and then update the main display to grade chart.

`GRADE_CHART` is an element in enumeration `ModelType` which determines what content is displayed in main screen.


### Extract emails

This feature allows a TA to easily mass email a selected group of students. A typical workflow is as such:
1. Use the `find` command to show a selected group of students of interest.
2. Use the `extract emails` command to generate a [deep link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_linking), which is copied to the clipboard
3. When the deep link is opened in the browser, the user is redirected to NUS WebMail with a draft email and selected recipients.

#### Current Implementation
The following sequence diagram shows how the extract emails command works. As it is a high-level diagram, `Ui`, `Logic` and `Model` refer to
components in ModQuik, rather than classes. `Clipboard` refers to the Java 11 Clipboard class.

![ExtractEmailsSequenceDiagram](images/ExtractEmailsSequenceDiagram.png)

Upon the user issuing the `extract emails` command, an `ExtractEmailCommand` is created. This step is not shown in the sequence diagram for breivity.

When the command is executed, the current list of students shown is retrieved from Model as an ObservableList of students.
This list is passed to the helper method `generateUrl`, which creates the deeplink required. This link is then pasted to the system clipboard via
an instance of Clipboard's method `setContent`.

An alternative is to generate a [mailto:](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mailto) link instead of deep links. However, it seems that Outlook Online
does not attach itself as a mailto: handler.

### Sort reminder
This feature allows a TA to sort the list of reminders by a given criteria. TA could either choose to sort by
* priority
* deadline

If priority is chosen, reminders will be sorted from `HIGH` to `MEDIUM` to `LOW`, whereas if deadline is chosen, reminders will be sorted chronologically from earliest to latest.

#### Current Implementation
It is implemented by the SortReminderCommandParser and SortReminderCommand classes.<br>
`SortReminderCommandParser` is responsible for parsing and validating the parameters inputted by the user while `SortReminder` class is responsible for sorting the reminders in the reminder list.<br>
The following sequence diagram shows how the `sort reminder` works.

![ExtractEmailsSequenceDiagram](images/ExtractEmailsSequenceDiagram.png)

1. The user enters `sort reminders by/priority` command in main window to sort the reminders by priority.
2. `LogicManager#execute` will then call `ModQuikParser#parseCommand` method, which then calls `SortReminderCommandParser#parse` method.
3. `SortReminderCommandParser` will check the parameter inputted by the user, and create a new instance of `SortReminderCommand` with the corresponding sorting criteria.
4. `SortReminderCommandParser` will return the new `SortReminderCommand` instance to `ModQuikParser`, which in turns return to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` calls `SortReminderCommand#execute` method, which will then call either `Model#sortReminderByPriority()` or `Model#sortReminderByDeadline()` depending on the criteria that was initialised with the `SortReminderCommand`.
6. Reminder list will then be sorted according to the given criteria.
7. The `SortReminderCommand` then creates a new instance of `CommandResult` and return it to `LogicManager`.

## **7. Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**: NUS teaching assistants (TAs).

**Value proposition**: we want to evolve AB3 such that the fast-typist TAs are able to manage all the information of their teaching modules in one place including students' information, grade summary, tutorials, consultations and reminders. This allows TAs to keep track of their responsibilities, studentsâ€™ progress and schedules for the ongoing semester.

## 9. Effort

Implementing ModQuik was not easy. We have summarised the difficulties and challenges our team have encountered when developing ModQuik and listed it below.

### Code Design
As we are creating a tool for TAs to manage all their teaching responsibilities, we have to implement several new entities (`Tutorial`, `Consultation` and `Reminder`) for ModQuik as compared to AB-3 where there was only 1 entity type (`Person`).
When applicable, we try to abstract out commonly reused classes.
We also created multiple Parser classes for each of the subsequent classes that we have created in order for our commands to work properly.
As we used multi-word commands, this poses yet another challenge to implement a bug-free way of parsing inputs as it created more ways for invalid inputs to occur.

One major challenge that we faced was limiting the number of classes that a TA could add. In reality, TAs could only teach up to 2 modules every semester. Though rare, a student may also end up having the same TA for 2 mods.
However, this would require us to implement tight constraints on our user as we would have to validate the inputs every step along the way.
The most inconvenient aspect is that editing any student entry that involves changing the module code will require user to first delete a module (if they are already capped at 2 modules) and then add the new module.

This presents yet another dilemma, because if the TA deletes the module code, then by design all the student entries related to the module should be deleted as well.
Moreover, if we were to link the module to the students, editing the tutorial module code will also edit all the affiliated student entries, but this might not be the intended behaviour.

### User Interface
AB3 did not have any different tabs. There was only one page showing the Personâ€™s contacts.
By adding tabs, we could implement different UIs into each tab to give the user a better experience.
In order to do so, it requires us to put in more thought on how to render the tabs.
By default, JavaFx create tabs in horizontal order on the top of TabPane and changing the tabs at left will cause the headers be vertical.
We had to tackle aspects regarding setting tabs placed at left and ensuring keeping the tab headers horizontal.
Furthermore, having multiple tabs required us to manipulate the tab toggling for certain commands as our target user is fast-typists who prefer typing over other means of input.
In addition, we encountered difficulties in creating a pie chart and customizing the chart legends to show the number of students in each category, which required much time.
Finally, implementing and styling the UI was not easy. Changing layout and adding icons is important to provide a standardised and modern look to the application.
In order to do so, it required us to overhaul the existing CSS file in AddressBook Level-3.
