### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Sort Task Command

#### How the feature works

The `sort` command allows users to sort the task list by priority status,
deadline, module code and task description with ease. The sort command operates
directly on the `ObservableList` stored under `DistinctTaskList` in `AddressBook` so the
`ObservableList` in `DistinctTaskList` will be permanently sorted to the criteria.
* When sorting by priority, all tasks with `HIGH` priority status will be positioned at the top of the 
displayed task list, followed by `MEDIUM`, `LOW` and 
lastly all tasks with no priority tags.
* When sorting by deadline, all tasks with deadline tags will be displayed 
at the top of the displayed task list with the task with the earliest deadline
being displayed at the top. All the remaining tasks with no deadline tags will
be displayed below all tasks with deadline tags.

`sort` command adheres to the following format: `sort c/CRITERIA`

`CRITERIA` can be one of the following criteria:
* `priority`
* `deadline`
* `module`
* `description`

#### Sequence of the SortTaskCommand

Shown below is a sequence diagram of what occurs when the `excute` method of
`LogicManager` is invoked.

<img src="images/SortTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png" />

**Sequence of actions made when `execute` method of `LogicManager` is invoked**
1. `LogicManager` object takes in `"sort c/priority"` which the user keys into the command line. 
2. `LogicManager` object calls the `parseCommand` of the `AddressBookParser` object created during the initialisation 
of `LogicManager` object and passes the `"sort c/priority"` as the arguments of `parseCommand`
3. `SortTaskCommandParser` object is created during execution of `parseCommand` of `AddressBookParser`
4. `SortTaskCommandParser` object calls its `parse` method with `"c/priority"` being passed in as argument.
5. `SortTaskCommand` object called st is created from `SortTaskCommandParser`
6. `excute` method of `SortTaskCommand` object st is invoked and model is passed in as
an argument.
7. `sortTaskList` method of `Model` is called with `"priority"` being passed as an
argument of the method
8. `execute` method of `SortTaskCommand` object returns a `CommandResult` object with
the sorted successfully message as argument to the `LogicManager` object. 

### Filter feature

#### Implementation

The proposed filter mechanism is facilitated by `FilterPredicate`. It implements `Predicate` with module, completion status and link status conditions, stored as `module`, `isCompleted` and `isLinked`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `FilterPredicate#test(Task)` — Checks if a task fulfils the given module and/or completion status and/or link status requirements.
* `FilterPredicate#toString()` — Returns a string representing all the conditions used during the filter operation.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredTaskList`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `filter m/CS2103T c/y l/n` command to filter the task list to show all CS2103T tasks that have been marked complete and are not linked to any exam. The `filter` command calls `Model#UpdateFilteredTaskList`, causing the task list to be filtered with the given conditions for `module`, `isCompleted` and `isLinked`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `module`, `isCompleted` and `isLinked` input is invalid, there will be an error message shown and the address book will continue to show the current `taskFilteredList`.

</div>

Step 3. The user executes `filter m/CS2103T c/n` command to filter the task list to show all CS2103T tasks that have been marked incomplete. The updated `taskFilterdList` will be filtered based on all the tasks, not only the ones which have been filtered out in the previous filter command from step 2.

Step 4. The user executes `mark 1`. The first task is no longer in `taskFilteredList` since its `isCompleted` is now false and no longer fulfils the conditions.

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

![FilterSequenceDiagram](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FilterCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the filter command:

<img src="images/FilterActivityDiagram.png" width="1150" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: User command input format:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Optional condition fields.
    * Pros: Easier to extend and add more conditions.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.

* **Alternative 2:** Compulsory condition fields.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Users have to type unnecessary details in command.

### Mark Task feature

#### Implementation

The proposed mark/unmark mechanism is facilitated by `MarkCommand`. It extends `Command` with a target index, stored internally as an `Index`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `MarkCommand#execute()` — Executes the mark command 

This operation is exposed in the `Command` abstract class as `Command#execute()`.

Given below is an example of how the mark mechanism works.

1. The user executes the `mark 1` command. 
2. The `MarkCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredTaskList()` which returns the filtered list of the tasks.
3. The `MarkCommand` command calls `List<Task>#get()` which returns the task at index 1 in the filtered list. 
4. Then, `MarkCommand` command calls `Task#mark()` to create a marked copy of the task.
5. This marked task has all fields similar to the original task, except its `TaskStatus` is `COMPLETE`. 
6. Then, `MarkCommand` command calls `Model#replaceTask()` which sets the first task in `Model#tasks` to the marked task.
 
The following sequence diagram shows how the mark operation works:

![MarkTaskSequenceDiagram](images/MarkTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `MarkCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
  
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the command has an invalid format or the index is greater than the number of tasks shown, `Model#replaceTask()` will not be called, so the task list will not change. If so, `MarkCommand` will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the command.
  
The `UnmarkCommand` works the same — the only difference is that it calls `Task#unmark()`, which returns a copy of the task with `TaskStatus` set to `INCOMPLETE`.
  
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new mark command:
  
![MarkTaskActivityDiagram](images/MarkTaskActivityDiagram.png)

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()` — Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()` — Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David …​` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
    * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### \[Proposed\] Data archiving

_{Explain here how the data archiving feature will be implemented}_
![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)


### \[Proposed\] Add Exam Command

### Add Exam Command

#### How the feature works
The `addExam` command allows users to add an exam to the `DistinctExamList` 
in `AddressBook`, with the following fields of exam module, exam description, 
and exam date.

#### Sequence of the AddExamCommand
**Sequence of actions made when `execute` method of `LogicManager` is invoked**
![AddExamCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddExamCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 1. The user launches the application. 

Step 2. The user types an `addExam` command. 

Step 3. The command calls `LogicManager#execute()` with 
the command input as the argument, which then calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand() ` 
with command input as the argument. 

Step 4. `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` matches the command to be 
a `addExam` command through the command word, which then calls `AddExamCommandParser#parse()`.

Step 5. `AddExamCommandParser#parse()` then parses the command to get `Module`, `ExamDescription` 
and the `ExamDate` objects of the exam by calling their respective `ParserUtil` parse methods. These 
methods will check if the inputted exam description, exam date and module are valid. If it is valid,
the object will be created. Otherwise, exception will be thrown. Then, an `Exam` object is created 
with the three objects as arguments. 

Step 6. `AddExamCommandParser#parse()` returns a new `AddExamCommand` object created with the `Exam`
object created previously as the argument in the constructor. `LogicManager` class will call 
`AddExamCommand#execute()` with a `Model` object as the argument. 

Step 7. `AddExamCommand#execute()` will check if model already contains the module of the exam 
through `Model#hasModule()`. If it does not contain the module, an exception will be thrown to 
indicate the module is not found. It will also check if the model already contains the exam 
through `Model#hasExam()`. If it contains the exam, an exception will be thrown 
to indicate that the exam has already been added.

Otherwise, it will call `ModelManager#addExam()` with the exam as the argument, 
which calls `AddressBook#addExam()` that will add the exam to the `DistinctExamList`, 
which stores all the exams.`AddExamCommand#execute()` method returns a `CommandResult` 
object to display that the exam was successfully added.
