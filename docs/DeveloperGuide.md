## Introduction

CodeConnect is a **desktop app** specially designed for **Computer Science students from NUS**. With this app, not only can you manage your **tasks and contacts** effectively in one unified place, you can also conveniently search for peers to seek help or collaboration on a particular task.

This developer guide serves both as a **guide for new contributors** to navigate and start working on the project and as a reference to various code and feature **design decisions** for existing developers.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/codeconnect/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/codeconnect/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delc 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/codeconnect/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `TaskListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/codeconnect/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

<div class="page-new"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/codeconnect/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `CodeConnectParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddContactCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delc 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `CodeConnectParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddContactCommand`) which the `CodeConnectParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteTaskCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/codeconnect/model/Model.java)

![Model component class diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* similarly stores the task data (all `Task` objects, contained in a `UniqueTaskList` object) and the 'selected' `Task` objects as a filtered list exposed as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>`.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>
<div class="page-new"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-2/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/codeconnect/storage/Storage.java)

![Storage component class diagram](images/StorageClassDiagram.png)

The `Storage` component,
* can save address book data, task list data  and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from `AddressBookStorage`, `TaskListStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as any one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.codeconnect.commons` package.

## Implementation

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Finding Feature

#### About

CodeConnect has features that allow you to search for tasks and contacts. The finding features use the following commands:

* `find n/` - Finds tasks in the TaskList by their description(name)
* `find m/` - Finds tasks in the TaskList by their module
* `findc n/` - Finds contacts in the AddressBook by their name
* `findc m/` - Finds contacts in the AddressBook by their module
* `findc ts/` - Finds contacts in the AddressBook by the module of the task at the given index

Examples of command use:
- `find n/ quiz` - Find all tasks containing the word "quiz"
- `find m/ CS1101S` - Find all tasks belonging to CS1101S
- `findc n/ Tan` - Find all contacts with names containing "Tan"
- `findc m/ CS1101S` - Find all contacts taking CS1101S
- `findc ts/ 3` - Find all contacts taking the module of the task at index 3

![Sample result of a find command](images/findTask.png)

#### Implementation Flow

Only the execution of `findc` command will be shown below as all the commands are implemented in a similar way.

Outline of how components work together when the user enters a find command:

1. User enters `findc m/ CS1101S` into the command prompt box
2. The user input will be sent to `CodeConnectParser`
3. `CodeConnectParser` send the argument `m/CS1101S` to `FindContactCommandParser`
4. `FindContactCommandParser` determines the user's input to be valid
5. `FindContactCommandParser` creates a `ModuleTakenPredicate`
   - This `Predicate` is used by the `Model` to filter for contacts that take the queried module
6. A `FindContactCommand` command is created and executed by the `Model`
7. The result of the find command is displayed to the user

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find n/ Lab 2` Command](images/FindTasksSequenceDiagram.png)
<div style="text-align: center">Sequence diagram of find command execution</div>
<p></p>
<div style="text-align: center">Note: The implementation flow and the activity and sequence diagrams are similar for both the find and findc commands</div>

#### Design Considerations

One design consideration was if the user should be allowed to find contacts matching more than one module. For example, the input `findc m/ CS1101S MA1521` will return all contacts taking CS1101S, MA1521, or both. The reason why we decided to use additive search condition is as follows:

Consider the following situation:
- You have two assignments due tomorrow, from two different modules: MOD_X and MOD_Y.
- Feeling stuck, you decide to use CodeConnect to search for help, to see if there's anybody you might have forgot.
- You enter the command `findc m/ MOD_X MOD_Y`

As a user in this situation, the last thing you would want is for the app to _exclude_ contacts taking both MOD_X and MOD_Y. Those would be the first people you want to ask for help!

Another design consideration was to make both the find commands for task and contacts easy to use and remember. For example, both `find` and `findc` uses the `n/` and `m/` prefixes, when searching by names and modules respectively.

This was done so that it would be easy for the user to remember what command to use when finding either contacts or tasks.
- The only difference when finding contacts is that there is a c after the find for contacts
- Both use the same prefixes

### Adding features

#### About

CodeConnect has features that allow you to add and track your contacts and tasks. The adding features use the following commands:

* `addc n/{name} p/{phone_number} [e/{email}] [a/{address}] [t/{tag}]... [m/{module}...] [gh/{github}] [tele/{telegram}]` - Adds a contact with the given field description
* `add {task_name} by/{deadline} [m/{module_code}]` - Adds a task with the given field description

Examples of command use:
* `add Lab2 by/2022-02-02 23:59 m/CS2030S` - Adds a task with the given field description
* `addc n/Bob Martin p/98765432 tele/bobmartin00 m/CS1101S CS1231S t/friend` - Adds a contact with the given field description

#### Implementation flow

Only the execution of `add` command will be shown below as both commands are implemented in a similar way.

Outline of how components work together when the user enters an add command:

1. User enters `add Finish Lab3 by/tomorrow m/CS2030S` into the command prompt box
2. The user input will be sent to `CodeConnectParser`
3. `CodeConnectParser` send the argument `Finish Lab3 by/tomorrow m/CS2030S` to `AddTaskCommandParser`
4. `AddTaskCommandParser` will call its `parse` method to get the details of the task
5. A new `task` instance is created with the fields which is passed into a new `AddTaskCommand` object
6. The `model` will then update the `taskList` with the new Task

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `add Add error handling by/next thursday m/CS2103T` Command](images/AddTaskCommandSequenceDiagram.png)
<div style="text-align: center">Sequence diagram of add command execution</div>

#### Design Considerations

* A natural date parser is used because it gives the most flexibility possible in the type of date formats that can be entered, including relative dates ("tomorrow") and abbreviations ("2 Jan").
* Uniquely, the LocalDateTime within Deadline is expected to be formatted to and from strings by the class's users. This is because different formats and strictnesses are appropriate in different situations.
  * `ParserUtil.parseDeadline` handles user input, so it uses the NaturalDateParser.
  * The `Storage` component uses a fixed format string so that saved data can be unambiguously restored.
  * Deadline(String) uses the format used before natural date parsing to reduce changes to test code.
* Deadline has a validation function for the input to its string constructor, just like other field classes. The validation is performed by attempting to parse it and checking for errors, as there is no cheaper method in this case.
* When a date range is specified, the end of the range is used; e.g. a task that's due "tomorrow" will be due 23:59 tomorrow. This is the most common interpretation in our experience.
* `Deadline`, as a thin data class, only provides constructors from preparsed LocalDateTimes and its own serialization. Parsing user input is handled by other methods, such as `ParserUtil.parseDeadline`. This improves cohesion of the class.
* The `add` command shares the `m/` prefix for modules with the other commands.
  * The `by/` prefix is chosen for the deadline, as it is a good compromise between brevity and comprehensibility ("do this *by* a certain date").


### Editing feature

#### About

CodeConnect has features that allow you to edit tasks and contacts. The editing feature use the following commands:

* `edit {task_index} {field prefix + field description}` - Edits the task at the specified index
* `editc {contact_index} {field_prefix + field_description}` - Edits the contact at the specified index

Example of command use:
* `edit 1 m/CS1101S` - Changes the module of the task at index 1 to be "CS1101S"
* `editc 2 p/91919100` - Changes the phone number of the contact at index 2 to "91919100"

#### Implementation flow

Only the execution of `edit` command will be shown below as both commands are implemented in a similar way.

Outline of how components work together when the user enters an edit command:
1. User enters `edit 3 m/CS1101S` into the command prompt box
2. The user input will be sent to `CodeConnectParser`
3. `CodeConnectParser` send the argument `3 m/CS1101S` to `EditTaskCommandParser`
4. `EditTaskCommandParser` will call its `parse` method to get the index and create a `EditTaskDescriptor` instance that stores the edited field
5. A new `EditTaskCommand` will then be created with the parsed index and `EditTaskDescriptor` object
6. That `EditTaskCommand` object will execute and a new `Task` will be created with the new fields
7. The `model` will then be updated accordingly with the new Edited Task.


![Activity Diagram](images/EditTaskActivityDiagram.png)
<div style="text-align: center">Activity diagram of edit command execution</div>

#### Design Considerations

* Initially we felt that being able to edit more than 1 field per edit task command was not as important, as
a task object does not have that many fields to begin with. However, we felt that implementing it will still
make it a lot easier in the event that a user want to have multiple changes to a task.

### Marking features

#### About

CodeConnect has features that allow you to mark and unmark your tasks as complete and incomplete respectively. The marking features use the following commands:
* mark {task_index} - Marks task at specified index as completed
* unmark {task_index} - Unmarks task at specified index as incomplete

Examples of command use:
* `mark 1` -  Marks the task at index 1 as complete
* `unmark 1` - Unmarks the task at index 1 as incomplete

#### Implementation flow

To represent the completion status of `Task`, a new `Task` attribute `status` of type `Status` is added. The boolean field 
`isComplete` in `Status` is `true` when a task is marked as complete and `false` when a task is incomplete.

Only the execution of `mark` command will be shown below as both commands are implemented in a similar way.

Outline of how components work together when the user enters a mark command:
1. User enters `mark 1` into the command prompt box
2. User input `mark 1` is passed to `LogicManager` which then calls `LogicManager#execute()` which then calls 
`CodeConnectParser#parseCommand()`.
3. It is determined the type of command is `mark` and a new `MarkTaskCommandParser` is created and `MarkTaskCommandParser#parse`
is called, parsing and validating the index.
4. If index is valid, a new `MarkTaskCommand` is created and returned to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` calls `MarkTaskCommand#execute()`. If there exists an unmarked task at index 1, 
`MarkTaskCommand#createMarkedTask()` is called, creating a copy of the task to be marked with its `status` set to `true`.
6. `Model#setTask()` is then called to replace the task to be marked with the marked copy.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `mark 1` Command](images/MarkTaskSequenceDiagram.png)
<div style="text-align: center">Sequence diagram of mark command execution</div>

The activity diagram below summarizes the implementation of a `mark` command. 

![Activity diagram for execution of a mark command](images/MarkTaskActivityDiagram.png)
 <div style="text-align: center">Activity diagram of mark command execution</div>


#### Design considerations

* One design consideration involved marking/unmarking multiple tasks by adding a space before inputting the index of another task.
However, users could forget to input spaces when inputting indexes of multiple tasks, leading to unintended tasks being
marked/unmarked without the users even realising it. Limiting the number of tasks that can be marked/unmarked to 1 is thus 
considered to be an acceptable trade-off.

### Listing features

#### About

CodeConnect has features that allow you to list out all the contacts and tasks. The listing features use the following commands:
* `list` - Shows a list of all tasks
* `list time` - Shows a list of all tasks sorted by deadline
* `listc` - Shows a list of all contacts

#### Implementation flow

Listing of tasks is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It contains `filteredTaskList` of type `FilteredList`. 
It also contains `sortedTaskList` of type `SortedList` that wraps `filteredTaskList` in it. As any changes to `filteredTaskList`
will be reflected in the `sortedTaskList`, the `Ui` displays `sortedTaskList` in the tasklist panel. `SortedList` contains the
method SortedList#setComparator(Comparator<? super E> comparator). The above method is called in 
`ModelManager#updateSortedTaskList(Comparator<Task> comparator)` that allows for the sorting of `sortedTaskList` with a comparator.

Only the execution of `list time` command will be shown below as all listing commands are implemented in a similar way.

Outline of how components work together when the user enters a list command:
1. User enters `list time` into the command prompt box
2. User input `list time` is passed to `LogicManager` which then calls `LogicManager#execute()` which then calls
   `CodeConnectParser#parseCommand()`.
3. It is determined the type of command is `list` and a new `ListTaskCommandParser` is created and `ListTaskCommandParser#parse`
   is called. It is determined that the input is a command for listing tasks by deadline.
4. A new `ListTaskCommand` is created with `DeadlineComparator` passed as parameter. `ListTaskCommand` is returned to `LogicManager`.
5. `LogicManager` calls `ListTaskCommand#execute()`. `Model#updateSortedTaskList()` is then called, setting the comparator 
   in `sortedTaskList` to `DeadlineComparator`. `Ui` then displays the tasks ordered by task with the earliest deadline on top.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `list time` Command](images/ListTaskSequenceDiagram.png)
<div style="text-align: center">Sequence diagram of list command execution</div>

#### Design considerations

* One design consideration involved deciding how tasks are ordered under default list command `list`.
One choice was for tasks to be ordered with most recently added task on top and the other was for 
tasks to be ordered with least recently added task on top. 
* The former was chosen in the end as under a daily use basis, a tasklist is likely to evolve rather
quickly. It was considered to be more convenient for a user to be able to see more recent and relevant 
tasks at the top without having to scroll towards the bottom of the tasklist.
