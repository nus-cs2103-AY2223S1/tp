### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Find feature

#### Implementation

The find mechanism is facilitated by `FindCommandParser` which implements `Parser`. It parses the user input and
returns a `FindCommand` object. The `FindCommand` object then calls the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` method to
update the list of persons shown to the user.

The find mechanism has two modes: generic and prefix-based.
- The generic mode is used when the user does not specify any prefix.
- The prefix-based mode is used when the user specifies at least one prefix.

Both modes use the `DetailsContainKeywordsPredicate` class to filter the person list, which uses the
`containsKeywordsIgnoreCase` method to check if the person's details contain the keywords.

Given below is an example usage scenario of the generic mode and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial
address book state, and the `filteredPersons` will be initialized to show all persons.

Step 2. The user executes `find Betsy` command to find the person named `Betsy` in the address book. The `find` command
calls `FindCommandParser#parse()` which will parse the command.

Step 3. Since this is a generic find command, `FindCommandParser` trims the user input and creates a
`DetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the trimmed user input. The `DetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate` object is
then passed to a newly created `FindCommand` object.

Step 4. The `FindCommand` object calls the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` method with the
`DetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate` object as the argument. The `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` method will then
update the `filteredPersons` list in `ModelManager` to show only persons that matches the predicate.
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `DetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate`
object will check if the person's details contains the keywords using the `containsKeywordsIgnoreCase` method in its
`test` method.

</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario of the prefix-based mode and how the find mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial
address book state, and the `filteredPersons` will be initialized to show all persons.
Step 2. The user executes `find n/Betsy` command to find the person named `Betsy` in the address book. The `find`
command calls `FindCommandParser#parse()` which will parse the command.

Step 3. Since this is a prefix-based find command, `FindCommandParser` uses `ArgumentTokenizer` to tokenize the user
input. `ArgumentTokenizer` will then find the prefixes in the user input and put the keywords in the respective
prefixes into a map. `FindCommandParser` will then create a `DetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate` object with the keywords
in the map. The `DetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate` object is then passed to a newly created `FindCommand` object.

Step 4. The `FindCommand` object calls the `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` method with the
`DetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate` object as the argument. The `Model#updateFilteredPersonList()` method will then
update the `filteredPersons` list in `ModelManager` to show only persons that matches the predicate.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** For prefix-based find command, the
`DetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate` object will check if the person's specified details based on the prefixes contains
the keywords using the `containsKeywordsIgnoreCase` method in its `test` method.

</div>

If the user input is invalid, `FindCommandParser#parse()` will throw a `ParseException` with the respective error. This
will give the user the correct syntax to use the find command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

<img src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find command:

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How find executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** One `FindCommand` class and `COMMAND_WORD` that handles both generic and
prefix-based find.
    * Pros: Less code duplication.
    * Pros: More user-friendly.
    * Cons: More complicated logic in `FindCommandParser` class.
    * Cons: Greater difficulty in implementing (more cases to consider).
* **Alternative 2:** One `FindCommand` class and `COMMAND_WORD` that handles generic find and multiple find classes
that handle prefix-based find e.g. `FindNameCommand`, `FindPhoneCommand`, `FindEmailCommand`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Pros: Less complicated logic in `FindCommandParser` class.
    * Cons: More code duplication (have to create new classes for each prefix that are almost identical).
    * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
    * Cons: Less user-friendly.
    * Cons: User must remember the different commands for each prefix.

### Add/Edit/Delete Tags Feature

#### Implementation

The addition, modification and deletion of tags are executed through `AddCommand`, `AddTagCommand`, `DeleteTagCommand`, `EditCommand`, and facilated by `Tag`, `TagType`, `UniqueTagTypeMap` and `UniqueTagList`.

Each candidate in the `UniquePersonList` has a `UniqueTagTypeMap`, which represents a map of the tag types and corresponding tags belonging to the person. `UniqueTagTypeMap` implements the following operations:

* `UniqueTagTypeMap#mergeTagTypeMap()`â€‰â€”â€‰Merges a `UniqueTagTypeMap` with the existing `UniqueTagTypeMap` of the candidate.
* `UniqueTagTypeMap#removeTags()`â€‰â€”â€‰Removes the tags from the `UniqueTagTypeMap` of the candidate.
* `UniqueTagTypeMap#mergeTag()`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a tag of the given tag type to the `UniqueTagTypeMap` of the candidate.
* `UniqueTagTypeMap#setTagTypeMap()`â€‰â€”â€‰Replaces the `UniqueTagTypeMap` of the candidate with the given `UniqueTagTypeMap`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `UniqueTagTypeMap` internally uses an `ObservableMap`, backed by a `HashMap`, that maps each tag type of the candidate to a `UniqueTagList` of tags.
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/edit/delete Tag mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user executes `addTag 3 st/Java dt/Bachelors` to add a skill tag `Java` and degree tag `Bachelors` to the 3rd candidate in the displayed list of candidates. After being parsed by the `AddTagCommandParser` to an `AddTagCommand`, the `AddTagCommand` initializes a new `UniqueTagTypeMap` with the existing `UniqueTagTypeMap` of candidate `3` by invoking the `UniqueTagTypeMap#setTagTypeMap()`, and merges the new tags by invoking `UniqueTagTypeMap#mergeTagTypeMap()`. After this, a new `Person` is created with the `updatedTags` and all other attributes same as that of the existing `Person`, and the `ModelManager#setPerson` is invoked to modify the addressBook with the updated candidate.

Step 2. The user executes `edit 3 st/Java-JavaScript` to edit the skill tag `Java` to `JavaScript` of the 3rd candidate in the displayed list of candidates. After being parsed by the `EditCommandParser` to an `EditCommand`, the `EditCommand` initializes a new `UniqueTagTypeMap` with the existing `UniqueTagTypeMap` of candidate `3` by invoking the `UniqueTagTypeMap#setTagTypeMap()`, removes the existing tags to be edited by invoking `UniqueTagTypeMap#removeTags()` and adds the edited tags by invoking the `UniqueTagTypeMap#mergeTagTypeMap()`. After this, a new `Person` is created with the `updatedTags` and all other attributes same as that of the existing `Person`, and the `ModelManager#setPerson` is invoked to modify the addressBook with the updated candidate.

Step 3. The user executes `deleteTag 3 st/JavaScript dt/Bachelors` to delete the skill tag `JavaScript` and degree tag `Bachelors` of the 3rd candidate in the displayed list of candidates. After being parsed by the `DeleteTagCommand` to a `DeleteTagCommand`, the `DeleteTagCommand` initializes a new `UniqueTagTypeMap` with the existing `UniqueTagTypeMap` of candidate `3` by invoking the `UniqueTagTypeMap#setTagTypeMap()` and removes the tags to be deleted by invoking `UniqueTagTypeMap#removeTags()`. After this, a new `Person` is created with the `updatedTags` and all other attributes same as that of the existing `Person`, and the `ModelManager#setPerson` is invoked to modify the addressBook with the updated candidate.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addTag` command operation works. The `deleteTag` command also operates in a similar fashion.

![AddTagCommandSequenceDiagram](images/AddTagCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: How the addressBook is updated:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new person each time a tag is added, edited or deleted.
    * Pros: Ensures that `Person` and all its attributes are immutable.
    * Cons: May be inefficient compared to directly updating the attributes of `Person`.

* **Alternative 2:** Modifies the existing `UniqueTagTypeMap` of the candidate each time a tag is added, edited or deleted.
  itself.
    * Pros: May be more efficient, as a new `Person` instance is not created every time a tag is added, edited or deleted.
    * Cons: Allowing `Person` to be mutated may not be safe and defensive.


### Create/Edit/Delete Tag Types feature

For the ease of classifying tags and storing candidate information in a more organised way, users can now also create Tag Types and assign tags to the relevant Tag Types.

This feature is facilitated by `UniqueTagTypeMap` class. It implements the `Iterable<TagType>` interface.
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* UniqueTagTypeMap#createTagType() â€‰â€”â€‰ Creates a unique Tag Type and adds it to the prefixMap of available Tag Types.
* UniqueTagTypeMap#setExistingTagType() â€‰â€”â€‰ Edits the Tag Type name and Tag Type alias of an existing Tag Type.
* UniqueTagTypeMap#removeExistingTagType() â€‰â€”â€‰ Deletes a Tag Type from the prefixMap and, hence, the Tag Type is no more recognised as a valid Tag Type.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `prefixMap` in `UniqueTagTypeMap` is a HashMap that maps all the existing Tag Type alias to their respective Tag Types. For user convenience, we have already provided the user with the three basic Tag Types a recruiter might need: Skills Tag Type (alias: st/), Degree Tag Type (alias: dt/), and Job Type Tag Type (alias: jtt/)<br>
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the create/edit/delete Tag Types mechanism behaves at each step:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `prefixMap` in the `UniqueTagTypeMap` will be initialised with the initial 3 Keyâ€‰â€”â€‰Value pairs: st/â€‰â€”â€‰Skills, dt/â€‰â€”â€‰Degree, and jtt/â€‰â€”â€‰Job Type.

Step 2. The user executes `createTagType Grade grdt` command to add a Grade Tag Type to the available Tag Types so that the recruiter can now add Tags of Grade Tag Type to candidates using the alias grdt/. The `createTagTYpe` command calls the `UniqueTagTypeMap#createTagType()`, causing the addition of grdt/â€‰â€”â€‰Grade key-value pair to the `prefixMap`.

Step 3. The user executes the 'editTagType Grade-Score grdt-scrt' to edit the existing Tag Type Grade and rename it as Score. The `editTagType` command calls the `UniqueTagTypeMap#setExistingTagType()` to remove the grdt/â€‰â€”â€‰Grade key-value pair from the `prefixMap` and add scrt/â€‰â€”â€‰Score key-value pair to the `prefixMap`. Furthermore, the `editTagType` command also calls 'Model#editTagTypeForAllPerson()' to edit the Grade Tag Type name and rename it as Score Tag Type for all person who had Tags of Grade Tag Type.

Step 4. The user executes the `deleteTagType Score` to delete the Score Tag Type and all Tags of Score Tag Type for all person in CLInkedIn. The `deleteTagType` command calls the `UniqueTagTypeMap#removeExistingTagType()` to remove the scrt/â€‰â€”â€‰Score key-value pair from the `prefixMap`. Furthermore, it also calls the `Model#deleteTagTypeForAllPerson()` to delete the Score Tag Type and the Tags assigned to the Score Tag TYpe for each person having Tags of Score Tag Type.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `createTagType` command operation works:

![CreateTagTypeSequenceDiagram](images/CreateTagTypeSequenceDiagram.png)

### Status feature

#### Implementation

The proposed `Status` feature is added as an attribute under the `Person` class.

A `Status` class is created, and is implemented via a `String`. The String can only take in alphanumeric inputs.

Some example statuses include:
- Application Received
- OA in Progress
- Shortlisted for Interview
- Accepted
- Rejected

The `Status` attribute is mainly implemented by the following methods:
- `Status` can be added via the `AddCommand`, eg: `add n/John Doe e/john@mail.com p/10384280 s/Application Received` adds a new candidate with name `John Doe`, email `john@mail.com`, phone number `10384280`, and status of `Application Received`.
- `Status` can be edited via the `EditCommand` eg: `edit 1 s/OA in Progress` edits `Status` field of the 1st candidate in CLInkedIn to `OA in Progress`.

It is also additionally facilitated by these methods:
- `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` - Checks the input for `AddCommand` or `EditCommand`
- `AddCommandParser#parse()` - Checks the input for the status prefix, only adds a candidate into CLInkedIn if the entry has a `Status` prefix and a valid `Status` input
- `EditCommandParser#parse()` - Checks the input for the status prefix, only edits the candidate's `Status` if the entry has a `Status` prefix and a valid `Status` input

Here is an example of what happens when the recruiter attempts to add a candidate to CLInkedIn:
1. Recruiter enters the command `add n/John Doe p/999 e/john@mail/com a/singapore s/Application Received`
2. The command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which identifies the command word of every command.
3. Since this is an `AddCommand`, the remaining arguments are passed into `AddCommandParser#parse()`
4. Each of the different arguments of a candidate (name, phone, email, address, status) are parsed by `AddCommandParser#parse()`
5. If any of the compulsory arguments of a candidate (name, phone, email, address, status) are not present, the command will fail its execution and `ParseException` will be thrown.
6. Else, an `AddCommand` object is generated.
7. Next, the `AddCommand#execute()` is called, which triggers the `Model#addPerson(Person)` command and a `CommandResult` is returned

Following is a sequence diagram that illustrates what happens when a Person with status is added to CLInkedIn:

![AddCommandStatusSequenceDiagram](images/AddCommandStatusSequenceDiagram.png)

Here is an example of what happens when the recruiter attempts to edit a candidate's status  CLInkedIn:
1. Recruiter enters the command `edit 1 s/OA In Progress`
2. The command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which identifies the command word of every command.
3. Since this is an `EditCommand`, the remaining arguments are passed into `EditCommandParser#parse()`
4. Each of the different arguments to be edited are parsed by `EditCommandParser#parse()`.
5. An `EditPersonDescriptor` is created and modified depending on the arguments to be edited.
6. An `EditCommand` object is generated.
7. Next, the `EditCommand#execute()` is called, which triggers the `Model#setPerson(Person)` and `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` commands
8. A `CommandResult` is returned.

#### Design Considerations

It is designed to be a mandatory feature, as every candidate under the recruiting process must be at an application stage.

### Note feature

#### Implementation

The proposed `Note` feature is added as an optional attribute under the `Person` class.

A `Note` class is created, and is implemented via a `String`. The String can take in any input, including a blank string.

The `Note` attribute is mainly implemented by the following methods:
- `AddNoteCommand` - Adds a note to a candidate **by appending the new note to the end of the candidate's current list of notes**, eg: `addnote 4 note/Strong at Java` adds a `Note` of `Strong at Java` to the 4th candidate in CLInkedIn. 
- `DeleteNoteCommand` - Deletes **all notes** of a candidate, eg: `deletenote 1` deletes all notes of the 1st candidate in CLInkedIn.
- `AddCommand` - Adds a new candidate with note, eg: `add n/John Doe e/john@mail.com p/10384280 s/Application Received rate/9 note/Has applied twice` adds a new candidate with name `John Doe`, email `john@mail.com`, phone number `10384280`, status of `Application Received`, rating of `9` with a note of `Has applied twice`. 
- `EditCommand` - Edits the note of a candidate by **overwriting their existing notes with the new inputted note**, eg: `edit 2 note/Has a dog` edits `Note` of the 2nd candidate in CLInkedIn to `Has a dog` by overwriting any existing notes of the 2nd candidate.

It is also additionally facilitated by these methods:
- `AddNoteCommandParser#parse()` - Checks the input for the Note prefix, only adds a candidate into CLInkedIn if the entry has a `Note` prefix and a valid `Note` input.
- `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` - Checks the input for `AddCommand` or `EditCommand`

Here is an example of what happens when the recruiter attempts to add a note to a candidate in CLInkedIn:
1. Recruiter enters the command `addNote 1 note/Good at Java`.
2. The command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which identifies the command word of every command.
3. Since this is an `AddNoteCommand`, the remaining arguments are passed into `AddNoteCommandParser#parse()`.
4. The index of the candidate and the note to be added are parsed by `AddNoteCommandParser#parse()`. It calls `ParserUtil#parseIndex()` to parse the index and `ParserUtil#parseNote()` to parse the note.
5. If the index is invalid, the command will fail its execution and `ParseException` will be thrown.
6. Else, an `AddNoteCommand` object is generated with `Index` 1 and `Note` "Good at Java".
7. Next, the `AddNoteCommand#execute()` is called, which adds the note to the candidate using `Person#mergeNote(note)` and returns a `CommandResult`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add note operation via `AddNoteCommand` works:
![AddNoteSequenceDiagram](images/AddNoteSequenceDiagram.png)

Here is an example of what happens when the recruiter attempts to add a candidate with a note to CLInkedIn:
1. Recruiter enters the command `add n/John Doe p/999 e/john@mail/com a/singapore rate/9 note/Strong in Python.`
2. The command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which identifies the command word of every command.
3. Since this is an `AddCommand`, the remaining arguments are passed into `AddCommandParser#parse()`
4. Each of the different arguments of a candidate (name, phone, email, address, rating, status, note, tags, links) are parsed by `AddCommandParser#parse()`
5. If any of the compulsory arguments of a candidate (name, phone, email, address, status) are not present, the command will fail its execution and `ParseException` will be thrown.
6. Next, the `AddCommand#execute()` is called, which triggers the `Model#addPerson(Person)` command and a `CommandResult` is returned

Here is an example of what happens when the recruiter attempts to edit a candidate's Note in CLInkedIn:
1. Recruiter enters the command `edit 1 note/Missed 2 interviews`
2. The command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which identifies the command word of every command.
3. Since this is an `EditCommand`, the remaining arguments are passed into `EditCommandParser#parse()`
4. Each of the different arguments to be edited are parsed by `EditCommandParser#parse()`.
5. An `EditPersonDescriptor` is created and modified depending on the arguments to be edited.
6. An `EditCommand` object is generated.
7. Next, the `EditCommand#execute()` is called, which triggers the `Model#setPerson(Person)` and `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` commands
8. A `CommandResult` is returned.

#### Design Considerations

It is designed to be an optional feature, as it is meant to be a supplementary source of notetaking that recruiters can make on candidates saved.

### Rating feature

#### Implementation

The proposed `Rating` feature is added as an attribute under the `Person` class.

A `Rating` class is created, and is implemented via a `String`. The String can only take in integers from 1 to 10 inclusive.

The `Rating` attribute is mainly implemented by the following methods:
- `AddRateCommand` - Adds rating to a candidate who **does not currently have a rating**, eg: `addrate 4 rate/9` adds a `Rating` of 9 to the 4th candidate in CLInkedIn. 
- `DeleteRateCommand` - Deletes rating of a candidate, eg: `deleterate 1` deletes rating of the 1st candidate in CLInkedIn.
- `AddCommand` - Adds a new candidate with rating, eg: `add n/John Doe e/john@mail.com p/10384280 s/Application Received rate/9` adds a new candidate with name `John Doe`, email `john@mail.com`, phone number `10384280`, status of `Application Received` with rating of `9`. 
- `EditCommand` - Edits the rating of a candidate, eg: `edit 2 rate/9` edits `Rating` of the 2nd candidate in CLInkedIn to `9`.

It is also additionally facilitated by these methods:
- `AddRateCommandParser#parse()` - Checks the input for the rating prefix, only adds the rating to the candidate if the entry has a `Rating` prefix and a valid `Rating` input
- `DeleteRateCommandParser#parse()` - Checks the input for the rating prefix, only deletes the rating to the candidate if the entry has a valid `Rating` input
- `AddCommandParser#parse()` - Checks the input for the rating prefix, adds a candidate with rating into CLInkedIn if the entry has a `Rating` prefix and a valid `Rating` input
- `EditCommandParser#parse()` - Checks the input for the rating prefix, only edits the candidate's rating if the entry has a `Rating` prefix and a valid `Rating` input
- `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()` - Checks the input for `AddRateCommand`.

Here is an example of what happens when the recruiter attempts to add a rating to a candidate on CLInkedIn via the `AddRateCommand`:
1. Recruiter enters the command `addrate 4 rate/8`
2. The command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which identifies the command word of every command.
3. Since this is a `AddRateCommand`, the remaining arguments are passed into `AddRateCommandParser#parse()`
4. The different arguments (index, rating) are parsed by `AddRateCommandParser#parse()` and a `AddRateCommand` object is created.
5. Next, the `AddRateCommand#execute()` is called, which triggers the `Model#setPerson(Person)` and `Model#updateFilteredPersonList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_PERSONS)` commands
6. A `CommandResult` is returned.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add rate operation via `AddRateCommand` works:

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Compulsory vs Non-compulsory**
It is designed to be a non-compulsory feature, as the recruiter might not be able to rate every candidate at every stage of the recruiting process.

**Aspect: Argument type of the `Rating` constructor**
It is designed to take in a String, as Commands are parsed as a String. However, the constructor will parse the String and the Rating is stored as an Integer.

### Export/Import Feature

#### Implementation

##### Export
* In order to export in CSV format, The `Export` command creates and uses an instance of the `CSVWriter` class from the `OpenCSV` package which generates a CSV file line by line in the file specified by the user. 
* During the execution of the `Export` command, in order to convert the `personList` to a CSV Writable format, the `Person#getDetailsAsArray()` method is invoked on each person.
* The file-writing operations for CSV format can be found in the `exportToCsvFile()` method in `FileUtil`.
* In order to export in JSON format, The `Export` command uses the `saveJsonFile()` method in `JsonUtil` similar to how CLInkedIn uses the `saveJsonFile()` method to store the addressbook data.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Export` command operation works for a **CSV** file:


![ExportSequenceDiagram](images/ExportSequenceDiagram.png)
![ExportToCSVRefSequenceDiagram](images/ExportToCSVRefSequenceDiagram.png)


##### Import
* In order to import from a CSV file, the `Import` command creates and uses an instance of the `CSVReader` class from the `OpenCSV` package to read the CSV file line by line. 
* The file-reading operations can be found in the `importFromCsvFile()` method in `FileUtil`. 
* During the execution of the `Import` command, the details of each person received from the `importFromCsvFile` is validated and used to generate an instance of a `Person` by invoking the `ParserUtil#parsePerson()` method in `ParserUtil`.
* In order to import from a JSON file, The `Import` command uses the `readJsonFile()` method in `JsonUtil` similar to how CLInkedIn uses the `readJsonFile()` method to retrieve the addressbook data on launch.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `Import` command operation works for a **CSV** file:


![ImportSequenceDiagram](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)
![ImportFromCsvRefSequenceDiagram](images/ImportFromCsvRefSequenceDiagram.png)


<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the user executes the `import` or `export` command through the GUI Window, internally the `import` or `export` command is invoked, by appending `import ` or `export ` before the file path specified in the GUI Window respectively, and then passing the resultant `String` as an argument while invoking the `MainWindow#executeCommand()` method.
</div>
    

### Link Feature

#### Implementation

The proposed `Link` feature is added as an optional attribute under the `Person` class. A `Person` can have 0 or more links added to it and it stores all the links as a `Set` of `Link`.

This feature is facilitated by `Link` class. The `Link` class uses an external Java library for `URL` to store the links so that it can use the library to identify and generate the host platform for the link to display an appropriate icon for the link in the UI.

If a user doesn't provide links for a candidate while adding the candidate to the list then they can choose to add/update existing links using the `addLink` command. Moreover, the user can also replace/delete the entire list of existing links for a candidate using the `edit`/`delete` command.
These features are implemented using the following class/methods:
- `AddLinkCommandParser#parse()` - Extracts the index and all the links to be added to the candidate at the given index from the user input and calls `ParserUtil.parseLinks()` to get a `Set` of valid `Link`.
- `ParserUtil#parseLinks()` - It further calls the `parseLink()` method that parses the link, generates a valid `URL` and returns the URl after wrapping it using the `Link` data type.
- `Link#generatePlatform()` - It extracts the host from the given URL and generates the platform for the icon to be displayed in the UI as `linkedin`, `telegram`, `github`, `instagram`, `snapchat`, `discord`, `twitter`, or `facebook` if it is one of them or as `general` if it is not recognised.
- `AddLinkCommand` - After doing all the relevant checks it adds the `Set` of `Link` passed to it as a parameter to the person at the given index when its `execute()` method is called.
- `DeleteLinkCommandParser#parse()` - Parses the index of the candidate whose links are to be deleted.
- `DeleteLinkCommand` - Creates a copy of the person at the provided index but with no links and sets the person at the given index as the new person in the address book. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Since, while instantiating a `URL` in the `ParserUtil` the `URL` class throws an exception if the link is not in the correct format, we do not have an explicit method `isValidLink()` in the `Link` class to check for the validity of the link.<br>
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add/edit/delete links mechanism behaves at each step:

Assume, currently there are 3 people in the address book.

Step 1. The user executes `add n/John p/12345678 a/21 College Road e/john@gmail.com s/Application received rate/4 l/https://telegram.com` command to add a person the address book with a single link at index 4.

Step 2. The user executes `addLink 4 l/https://github.com l/https://linkedin.com` command to add 2 more links to person. Now, the person at index 4 will have a total for 3 links attached to it.

Step 3. The user clicks on the icon with the `Github` logo for the person at index 4 to view the Github link added for the person.

Step 3. The user executes the `edit 4 l/https://google.com` to replace the existing set of links for the person with a single link. Do note, since google is not a recognised platform by CLInkedIn, it will be displayed with a general link icon in the GUI.

Step 4. The user executes the `deleteLink 4` to delete all the links of the person at index 4.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `addLink` command operation works:

![AddLinkSequenceDiagram](images/AddLinkSequenceDiagram.png)

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.


### Sort feature 

#### Implementation 

The proposed sorting feature sorts candidates based on their rating. The candidates will then be displayed in descending order of rating. 

It is mainly implemented by the `SortCommand` method. 

Here is an example of what happens when the recruiter attempts to sort candidates on CLInkedIn:
1. Recruiter enters the command `sort`
2. The command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which identifies the command word of every command. 
3. Since this is a `SortCommand`, there is no parser. A `SortCommand()` object is returned by the parser. 
4. Next, the `SortCommand#execute(Model model)` is called, which triggers the `Model#updateSort(Comparator)` command 
5. Lastly, a `CommandResult` is returned.


The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find command:

![SortSequenceDiagram](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design Considerations 

As candidates with no ratings are implemented to have a rating of 0, the candidates with no ratings will be ordered below the candidates with ratings.

This is because the recruiter would have no opinion about candidates with no rating, and thus no need to make comparisons that include candidates with no rating. 

The purpose of this feature is such that recruiters can view candidates based on order of desirability, and they would not need to look at candidates with no rating and they do not know their desirability yet.

### Statistics feature

#### Implementation

The statistics feature displays a pie chart of the ratings of the candidates in CLInkedIn. 
It is mainly implemented by the `StatsCommand` class.

Here is an example of what happens when the recruiter attempts to view the statistics of the candidates on CLInkedIn:
1. Recruiter enters the command `stats`
2. The command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which identifies the command word of every command.
3. Since this is a `StatsCommand`, there is no parser. A `StatsCommand()` object is returned by the parser.
4. Next, the `StatsCommand#execute(Model model)` is called, which triggers the `Model#getRatingCount()` command
5. The `StatsCommand#execute(Model model)` then creates a map of the ratings and their respective counts.
6. A `CommandResult` is returned with the data to be displayed.
7. `MainWindow#executeCommand()` then calls `ResultDisplay#setChartToUse()` to set the chart to be displayed, which uses `CommandResult#getPieChartStats()` to get the data.
8. Lastly, the pie chart is displayed.

#### Design Considerations

The pie chart is displayed using the JavaFX library.

The count of each rating is stored in a map, where the key is the rating and the value is the count of the rating.

The percentage of each rating is calculated by dividing the count of the rating by the total number of candidates.

Both the count and percentage of each rating is displayed in the pie chart.

A pie chart is used to display the statistics as it is easy to understand and visually appealing, but future iterations of CLInkedIn may use a bar chart instead.

Future iterations of CLInkedIn may also allow the user to view the statistics of a specific tag, as well as other attributes of the candidates.

### View feature

#### Implementation

The proposed `View` feature allows the user to view the full details of a selected candidate. 

It is mainly implemented by the `ViewCommand` method. The `ViewCommand` method takes in an index of the candidate to be viewed. Eg: Executing `view 1` will view the first candidate in the list. 

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The `ViewCommand` may also be executed directly from the UI by clicking on the candidate card in the `PersonCard` component in CLInkedIn. Eg: Clicking on the first candidate card in the list will execute `view 1`.
</div>

Here is an example of what happens when the recruiter attempts to view a candidate on CLInkedIn:

1. The user enters the command `view 1` to view the first candidate in the list.
2. The command is first parsed by `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which identifies the command word of every command.
3. Since this is a `ViewCommand`, the `ViewCommandParser` is called to parse the remaining arguments.
4. The `ViewCommandParser` then calls `ParserUtil#parseIndex("1")` which parses the index of the candidate to be viewed. If the index is not a positive unsigned integer, a `ParseException` is thrown. If the index is valid, the index is returned to the `ViewCommandParser`.
4. The `ViewCommandParser` then creates a `ViewCommand` object with the index of the candidate to be viewed.
5. Next, the `ViewCommand#execute()` is called, which extracts the details of the candidate to be viewed from the `Model` using `Person#toString()`.
6. Lastly, a `CommandResult` is returned with the details of the Candidate to be viewed.

The following sequence diagram shows how the view operation works:

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

The `ViewCommand` is able to show the full details of a candidate in the result display window. This allows the user to view the full details of a candidate without having to scroll through the entire list of candidates. Additionally, this allows the person cards in the list to show only essential details, reducing clutter in the UI.

The user is also able to view the full details of a candidate by clicking on the candidate card in the `PersonCard` component in CLInkedIn. This allows the user to view the full details of a candidate without having to type in the command.
