## **Introduction**

#### What is TrackAScholar?

TrackAScholar (TAS) is a one of a kind desktop app. It is the **only** application that any university administrative staff needs.
TAS helps university administrative staff manage scholarship applications.
It can store all the applicant's details such as contact info and scholarship applied etc. in one place.

TAS has many features that university administrative staff can use to help speed up the application process immensely.
TAS presents the administrative staff with various options such as the ability to pin important applicants,
edit their details easily and find or filter for applicants with ease.

TAS is optimised for use via a ***Command Line Interface (CLI)*** while simultaneously having the benefits of a ***Graphical User Interface
(GUI)***. If you can type fast, TAS can handle your scholarship application process faster than conventional _GUI_ apps.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding _API_ `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its _API_ in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

[Return to top](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **_API_** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicantListPanel`, `PinList` and `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Applicant` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Logic component

**_API_** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TrackAScholarParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an applicant).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` _API_ call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">

:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram. This limitation applies to the remaining sequence diagrams in our guide.

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TrackAScholarParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `TrackAScholarParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

[Return to top](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**_API_** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />


The `Model` component,

* stores TrackAScholar data i.e., all `Applicant` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicantList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Applicant` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Major` list in the `TrackAScholar`, which `Applicant` references. This allows `TrackAScholar` to only require one `Major` object per unique Major, instead of each `Applicant` needing their own `Major` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

</div>

[Return to top](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**_API_** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W10-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/trackascholar/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both TrackAScholar data and user preference data in _json_ format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TrackAScholarStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.trackascholar.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Add applicant feature

**Implementation**

The add operation is facilitated by `AddCommandParser`. `AddCommandParser` will map the creation of an
`Applicant` based on the user input to be added to the applicant list in the `Model`.

`AddCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `add n/Sam p/98886767 e/sam@example.com s/NUS Merit Scholarship as/pending`, for example, to add a new applicant.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `add` and
   the arguments `n/Sam p/98886767 e/sam@example.com s/NUS Merit Scholarship as/pending`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `add` command and `AddCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `AddCommandParser#parse()`
   to map the various arguments via their prefixes (e.g. `Sam` is mapped using prefix `n/`).

3. `AddCommandParser#parse()` will then call `AddCommandParser#arePrefixesPresent()` to ensure that all mandatory prefixes are present
   in the user input, after which the various arguments will be retrieved via the prefixes and parsed into their respective attributes.

4. `AddCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `Applicant` with the various attributes before finally initializing and returning an `AddCommand`
   with the new `Applicant` as an argument.

5. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `AddCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#hasApplicant()` to check if the new `Applicant` is a
   duplicate of any applicant already stored in TrackAScholar. When the check has concluded and no duplicate was found, `Model#addApplicant()`
   is called to add the new `Applicant` into TrackAScholar.

6. `AddCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing details about the applicant's successful addition to TrackAScholar.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit applicant feature

**Implementation**

The edit operation is facilitated by `EditCommandParser`. `EditComamndParser` will map the creation of an
`EditApplicantDescriptor` based on the input prefixes. `EditApplicantDescriptor` stores the details to edit the 
applicant with, where user specified parameters to edit will replace the corresponding details of the current applicant.

`EditCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `edit 1 n/Sam p/91234567 e/samnew@example.com s/NUS Sports Scholarship as/accepted`, for example, to edit an existing applicant at index 1 in the list.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `edit` and
   the arguments `1 n/Sam p/91234567 e/samnew@example.com s/NUS Sports Scholarship as/accepted`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `edit` command and `EditCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `EditCommandParser#parse()`
   to map the various arguments via their prefixes (e.g. `Sam` is mapped using prefix `n/`) and creates an `Index` by calling
   `ParserUtil#parseIndex()`.

3. `EditCommandParser#parse()` will then call `EditCommandParser#isPrefixPresent()` to check which prefixes are present
   in the user input, to identify which parameter need to be changed.

4. `EditCommandParser#parse()` creates an `EditApplicantDescriptor` object with the various attributes to be changed before
   initializing and returning an `EditCommand` with the `EditApplicantDescriptor` and `Index` as an argument.

5. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `EditCommand#execute()`, which creates a new `Applicant` object with the updated applicant fields.
   `Model#hasApplicant()` is then called to check if the new `Applicant` is a duplicate of any other applicant already stored in TrackAScholar. 
   When the check has concluded and no duplicate was found, `Model#setApplicant()` is called to update the existing applicant with the new applicant.

6. `EditCommand#execute()` then invokes `Model#updateFilteredApplcantList()` to display the updated applicant in the applicant list.

7. `EditCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing details about the edited applicant.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `edit` Command example](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Remove applicants feature

**Implementation**

The remove operation is facilitated by `RemoveCommandParser`. `RemoveCommandParser` parses the user input into an
`ApplicationStatus` to compare with and remove, hence assisting the deletion of applicants from the applicant list
in the `Model`.

`RemoveCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the remove operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `remove accepted`, for example, to remove all applicants with accepted scholarship application status.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `remove` and
   the argument `accepted`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `remove` command and `RemoveCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `RemoveCommandParser#parse()`.

3. `RemoveCommandParser#parse()` now parses the argument and creates a new `ApplicationStatus` before finally initializing and returning a `RemoveCommand`
   with the new `ApplicationStatus` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `RemoveCommand#execute()`, which invokes `RemoveCommand#promptUserConfirmation()`. TrackAScholar now displays
   a window asking for the user's confirmation to remove the applicants. After the user confirms, `RemoveCommand#confirmRemove()` is called which
   in turn calls `Model#removeApplicant()` to remove all applicants from the list matching the targeted `ApplicationStatus`.

5. `RemoveCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing information of the successful removal.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the remove operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `remove` Command example](images/RemoveSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The _GUI_ interactions when `RemoveCommand#execute()` calls `RemoveCommand#promptUserConfirmation()`
is abstracted out as this sequence diagram aims to only demonstrate the interactions inside Logic Component for the `remove` command.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find applicant feature

**Implementation**

The find operation is facilitated by `FindCommandParser`. `FindCommandParser` will map the creation of a
`Predicate<Applicant>` based on the input prefixes. The following implementations support the creation of
`Predicate<Applicant>`:

* `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate`: Returns true if an applicant's `Name` partially matches with the inputs provided.
* `ScholarshipContainsKeywordsPredicate`: Returns true if an applicant's `Scholarship` partially matches with the inputs provided.
* `MajorContainsKeywordsPredicate`: Returns true if any of the applicant's `Major` partially matches with the inputs provided.

These predicates are combined using the `FindCommandParser#combinePredicateList()` method which chains the predicates using the
`Predicate#and()` method. `Predicate<Applicant>` then assist the filtering of the applicant list in the `Model` for returning
the search result.

`FindCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `find n/Sam s/Merit`, for example, to find an applicant.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `find` and
   the argument `n/Sam s/Merit`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `find` command and `FindCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `FindCommandParser#parse()`
   to map the various arguments via their prefixes (e.g. `Sam` is mapped using prefix `n/`).

3. `FindCommandParser#parse()` will then call `FindCommandParser#parsePredicates()` which invokes `FindCommandParser#isPrefixPresent()`
   to check which prefixes are present in the user input, hence identify which predicates are to be created.

4. In this example, a `NameContainsKeywordsPredicate` and `ScholarshipContainsKeywordsPredicate` are created which are chained
   into a `Predicate<Applicant>`. `FindCommandParser#parse()` then initializes and returns a `FindCommand` with the new
   `Predicate<Applicant>` as an argument.

5. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `FindCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` to filter out the
   applicants who do not match the predicate. When the operation has concluded, `Model#getFilteredApplicantList()`
   is called to retrieve the filtered list, such that TrackAScholar can count the total number of applicants found.

6. `FindCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing details of how many applicants were found.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `find` Command example](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a find command:

![Find command activity diagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

[Return to top](#table-of-contents)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Filter applicants feature

**Implementation**

The filter operation is facilitated by `FilterCommandParser`. `FilterCommandParser` parses the user input into an
`ApplicationStatusPredicate` which assist the filtering of applicant list in the `Model`.

`FilterCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the filter operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `filter pending`, for example, to filter out applicants with pending scholarship application status.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `filter` and
   the argument `pending`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `filter` command and `FilterCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `FilterCommandParser#parse()`
   which checks that the argument is a valid application status by calling `ApplicationStatus#isValidApplicationStatus()`.

3. After passing the check, `FilterCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `ApplicationStatusPredicate` with the argument before finally initializing and returning a `FilterCommand`
   with the new `ApplicationStatusPredicate` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `FilterCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#updateFilteredApplicantList()` to filter out the
   applicants with the non-matching application status. When the operation has concluded, `Model#getFilteredApplicantList()`
   is called to retrieve the filtered list, such that TrackAScholar can count the total number of applicants in that particular list.

5. `FilterCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing details of how many applicants were found with a matching scholarship application status.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the filter operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `filter` Command example](images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sort applicants feature.

**Implementation**

The sort operation is facilitated by `SortCommandParser`. `SortCommandParser` will map the creation of a
`Comparator<Applicant>` based on the user input which assist in the sorting of the applicant list in the `Model`.

`SortCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the sort operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `sort name`, for example, to sort all applicants by name in ascending lexicographic order.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `sort` and
   the argument `name`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `sort` command and `SortCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `SortCommandParser#parse()`
   which checks if the arguments have the valid parameter name and flag by calling `List#contains()` and `SortCommandParser#checkInputSizeAndReverseFlag()` respectively.

3. After passing the check, `SortCommandParser#parse()` creates a new `Comparator<Applicant>` with the argument before finally initializing and returning a `SortCommand`
   with the new `Comparator<Applicant>` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `SortCommand#execute()`, which invokes `Model#sortApplicants()` to sort the list of
   applicants with the `Comparator<Applicant` provided. When the operation has concluded, `Model#updateFilteredApplcantList()`
   is then called to display the sorted list.

5. `SortCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing information of the successful sorting.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the sort operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `sort` Command example](images/SortSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a sort command:

![Filter command activity diagram](images/SortCommandActivityDiagram.png)

in the Activity Diagram but due to limitation of PlantUML, the arrowhead converges on another.
</div>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Import feature

**Implementation**

The import operation is facilitated by `ImportCommand`. `ImportCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.
Data file must be stored in proper _Json_ format and named `trackAScholarImport.json` under the `./data` folder for the file to be properly read
when executing the `ImportCommand`.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The interactions with the `Storage` component when reading
the import data file `trackAScholarImport.json` is abstracted out as this implementation aims to only demonstrate the interactions inside
Logic Component for the `import` command.
</div>

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the import operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `import r`, for example, to import a trackAScholarImport file.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `import` and
   the arguments `r`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `import` command and `ImportCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `ImportCommandParser#parse()`

3. `ImportCommandParser#parse()` now initializes and returns an `ImportCommand` with the argument `r`.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `ImportCommand#execute()`, which reads the data file `trackAScholarImport.json` to obtain the
   imported applicant list.

5. The argument `r` is then read and understood, which `LogicManager#execute()` now invokes `Model#importWithReplace()` to add
   the applicants within the imported applicant list into the current `Model`. Duplicate applicants who have the
   same name are now updated with imported applicants and new imported applicants are added into the current applicant list. 

6. `ImportCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing information of a successful import.

The following sequence diagram shows how the import operation works:

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `import` Command example](images/ImportSequenceDiagram.png)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Pin applicant feature

**Implementation**

The pin operation is facilitated by `PinCommandParser`. `PinCommandParser` parses the user input into an `Index` to
assist in identifying the applicant to pin from the applicant list in the `Model`.

`PinCommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the pin operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `pin 1`, for example, to pin an existing applicant at index 1 in the list. This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`,
   which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `pin` and the argument `1`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `pin` command and `PinCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `PinCommandParser#parse()`.

3. `PinCommandParser#parse()` now parses the argument and creates a new `Index` before initializing a `PinCommand`
    with the new `Index` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `PinCommand#execute()`, which creates a new `Applicant` object with the updated `Pin` field.
   `Model#setApplicant()` is later invoked, which updates the existing applicant with the new applicant.

5. `PinCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing information of the successful pinning of an applicant.

### UnPin applicant feature

**Implementation**

The unpin operation is facilitated by `UnPinCommandParser`. `UnPinCommandParser` parses the user input into an `Name` to
assist in identifying the applicant to unpin from the applicant list in the `Model`.

`UnPincommand` extends `Command` and implements the `Command#execute` operation.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the unpin operation is handled by TrackAScholar:

1. The user enters `unpin Alex Yeoh`, for example, to unpin a pinned applicant with full name matching `Alex Yeoh`.
   This invokes `LogicManager#execute()`, which calls `TrackAScholarParser#parseCommand()` to separate the command word `unpin` and
   the argument `Alex Yeoh`.

2. `TrackAScholarParser` identifies the `unpin` command and `UnPinCommandParser` will be instantiated which calls `UnPinCommandParser#parse()`.

3. `UnPinCommandParser#parse()` now parses the argument and creates a new `Name` before initializing a `UnPinCommand`
   with the new `Name` as an argument.

4. `LogicManager#execute()` now calls `UnPinCommand#execute()`, which creates a new `Applicant` object with the updated `Pin` field.
   `Model#setApplicant()` is later invoked, which updates the existing applicant with the new applicant.

5. `UnPinCommand#execute()` finishes with returning a `CommandResult` containing information of the successful unpinning of an applicant.

The following sequence diagram shows how the unpin operation works:

## **Appendix: Effort**

Given that the effort for creating AddressBook3(AB3) is rated as a 10, our team believes that the effort required to 
build TrackAScholar is estimated around 12.

Over the span of 1 month, my group has spent tremendous amount of time and energy in refactoring and transforming
AB3's model, such that it fulfils the criterion and standards needed by TrackAScholar.

Moreover, this is supported by the fact that our code contributions are approximated around 9k lines of code(LoC), emphasizing 
our commitment to improving the features and testability of TrackAScholar and improving the overall experience for our users.


### Outstanding features

* Add
* Edit
* Remove
* Clear
* Find
* Filter
* Sort
* Import
* Pin / Unpin


### Notable Achievements accomplished

* Utilised Test Driven Development
  * Every time our team puts in either a new feature or a new field to TrackAScholar, 
  we strive to write JUnit test cases alongside the new functional code added,
  thus minimising the chances of obtaining bugs at a later stage, where it might be too
  late or difficult to fix such bugs.
  * Moreover, we also took turns testing each other's features at various milestones, 
  thus allowing us to identify and amend bugs much earlier.
  * After PED, my team start rectifying and filtering the respective bugs into its respective severity immediately,
  thus mitigating the number of bugs in TrackAScholar for future releases.

* Maintained high code quality and standards
  * By following the large amount of abstraction possessed by AB3, we aim to minimise duplicability of code in TrackAScholar 
  and thus reducing the amount of code written. This is evident from `Command` and `Ui` interfaces etc.
  * Moreover, we adhered to the KISS principle and tried to keep our methods short and simple, thus
  maintaining readability of our code. This is evident from the lack of long methods and nesting within TrackAScholar 
  code base.
