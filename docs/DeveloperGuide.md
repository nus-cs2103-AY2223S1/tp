### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Appointment` objects residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and all `Appointment` objects (which are contained in a
`UniqueAppointmentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects and `Appointment` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as separate _filtered_ lists which are exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` and `ObservableList<Appointment>` respectively that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to these lists so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the lists change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save idENTify data, command history data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### List Feature

#### Implementation
The list patients/appointments mechanism is facilitated by the `UniquePersonList` and `UniqueAppointmentList`
respectively. They extend `Iterable` and store lists of `Person` and `Appointment`.

An example usage scenario of list patients/appointments is given below:


**Steps:**
1. After launching the application, user executes the command `find alex` to search for entries in both
`UniquePersonList` and `UniqueAppointmentList` that contains "alex". This causes entries in the list which
does not contain "alex" to be hidden from the GUI. This will set the premise of using `list patients` and
`list appts`.

2. When user wants to view the full list of patients again, he/she can enter the command `list patients`. Note that
this command only interacts with the `UniquePersonList` and not the `UniqueAppointmentList`, thus it will not modify
the displayed list of appointments in any way.

3. When user wants to view the full list of appointments again, he/she can enter the command `list appts`. Note that
   this command only interacts with the `UniqueAppointmentList` and not the `UniquePersonList`, thus it will not modify
   the displayed list of patients in any way.

4. When user wants to view the full lists of both patients and appointments again, he/she can enter the command `list all`. 

The activity diagram below summarises the above points.

<img src="images/ListActivityDiagram.png" width="300" />

To help you understand what is going on behind the scenes, here is a sequence diagram that demonstrates how
`list patients` work:

<img src="images/ListPatientsSequenceDiagram.png" width="500" />

From the diagram, the `ListCommand` object passes the predicate to show all entries to the `ModelManager`, which
will call onto a JavaFX function to modify the displayed list. 

For `list appts`, it follows a similar
process as well, but with `updateFilteredAppointmentList()` instead. For `list all`, you can think of the
behaviour as executing both `list patients` and `list appts`.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How the command is implemented:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `list patients`, `list appts` and `list all` as a command word `list` with
3 different descriptors which are not considered as arguments.
  * Pros: No additional parser class required
  * Cons: `ListCommand#execute()` will have more lines of code.
* **Alternative 2:** `list` as a command word with arguments `patients`/`appts`/`all` following it.
  * Pros: Seems more aligned with other commands that require more than 1 word of input
  * Cons: Require an additional `ListCommandParser` to work; more lines of code required.

We ultimately went with Alternative 1 since we do not expect `list` to take in many different arguments.

### Cancel Feature

#### Implementation
The implemented cancel feature allows users to cancel a patient's appointment based on its index in the appointment list. <br>
It is implemented similar to other idENTify commands and it extends `SelectAppointmentCommand`, an abstract class which encapsulates
operations which require selecting appointments from an appointment list.

The logical flow of using this command is shown in the activity diagram given below.

![Activity Diagram](images/CancelActivityDiagram.png)

The `AddressBookParser` will first check for the `cancel` command word. The cancel command
is facilitated by the `CancelCommandParser` and `CancelCommand` classes. The `CancelCommandParser`
parses the user input and obtains the index inputted by the user, before creating the cancel command to
execute the deletion of the appointment from the current appointment list.

Given below is an overview of how the cancel command executes the deletion of an appointment to delete the
first appointment (index 1) in the appointment list:

![Cancel Command](images/CancelSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How we decided to choose the user command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Select an appointment index from appointment list
  * Pros: More convenient for the end user to just choose the indexed appointment from the current appointment list.
  * Cons: The details of a patient's appointments will not be shown under the patient's details in the patient's list.

* **Alternative 2:** Use both patient and appointment index to select an appointment to delete.
  itself.
  * Pros: Intuitive if the user just wants to delete a specified patient's appointments.
  * Cons: Appointments will have to be shown under tha patient list which will clutter up the UI.

Our team decided to change the user input format of the cancel command from `cancel PATIENT_INDEX APPOINTMENT_INDEX`
to `cancel APPOINTMENT_INDEX`, so it is faster for
the user to key in, and also more similar to the other commands with only 1 index.

### Hide Feature
- The `hide patients` command hides patients based on at least 1 tag or name given. If more than 1 tag or name is given,
then any patients that match that tag or name will be hidden.
For example, `hide patients t/nose t/ear` will hide all patients that has either a nose or ear tag.
- The `hide appts` command works in exactly the same way, but the conditions are the reason, tag, and status of
the appointment. For example, `hide appts s/marked` will hide all appointments that are marked.

#### Implementation
The key idea of hide and other organisational commands is to allow users to successively filter out patients,
so that they can operate on a small list that they are interested in. For example, `hide patients n/Alex` and then
followed by `hide patients t/ear` should apply both hide commands successively, each time hide is applied on the current
shown list instead of the entire patient list.

To implement this, and to ensure that hide works well with other organisational features such as find and unhide, we
maintain an overarching HiddenPredicateSingleton which captures the state of the current patient and appointment list.
This singleton serves as a global predicate which is updated every time an organisational command is entered.

Each time the command is executed, the current patient/appointment predicate will be combined with (AND operation)
a predicate that is the complement of the given condition, since entries that satisfy the model predicate will be shown
, and thus to hide we will have to apply a NOT operation to the given condition e.g `hide patients t/ear` means we should
combine the current patient list predicate with a predicate that will fail if the patient tag contains ear.
The activity diagram below will illustrate a hide patient process. A similar process applies for hide appointment.

![Hide Patients](images/HidePatientsActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations
**Aspect: How hide patient/appointment executes:**

* **Current choice:** Making use of a singleton class to capture the state of the patient/appointment list at all times.
* A singleton pattern is used here, because we only should have a single instance of HiddenPredicate to act as a global
variable that holds the state of the current list shown to the user. If more than one object is created by mistake,
there is a risk that our organisational commands no longer work correctly, as the same global predicate must be shared
among all organisational commands such as find/group/hide/unhide.

**Aspect: Whether hide should hide by any match or all match**
* **Current choice:** Making hide any match, meaning patients/appts that match any of the keywords will be hidden.
E.g: `hide appts s/unmarked t/ear` will hide all appointments that is either unmarked OR has a ear tag.
* **Alternative:** Making hide all match meaning `hide appts s/unmarked t/ear` only hides appointments that satisfy
both the status and tag conditions.
* We decided to go with any match so that it is easier for users if they want to hide many types of entries at one go,
as opposed to all match since the user will have to key in hide many times successively.

**Aspect: How hide patients should affect appointment list**
* **Current choice:** Hiding patients will also hide their appointments, and unhiding patients will also unhide their appointments <br>
**Explanation:** We decided on this implementation because hiding a patient would imply that the user has no interest in this patient, and thus the appointments of the patient are also hidden so that the user can focus on other patients that he did not hide. Similarly, unhiding a patient implies that the user has interest in the particular patient, and thus the patient's appointments will also be shown.
On the other hand, hiding and unhiding appointments does not affect the patient list as the user may only be interested in going through the appointments.
* **Alternative:** Hiding/Unhiding patients do not affect appointment list at all <br>
This approach is easier to implement, as we do not have to worry about the appointment list and we only need to update the patient list. However, we wanted to make it more convenient for the user, as there is no good way to hide appointments of a particular patient if we have no interest in the patient. 

### Group Patient Feature

#### Implementation

The group mechanism implements the following operations:

* Group patients according to their tags.

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#GroupPatientCommand()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `idENTify` will be initialized with the initial
patient list.

Step 2. The user executes `group patients` command to group patients by their tags, causing the modified list of
patients after the `group patients` command executes to show on the screen.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute
("group patients")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `group patients` Command](images/GroupPatientSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/GroupPatientCommand.png" width="1000" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How group patients executes:**

* **Current choice:** Use a different comparator from default so that a heavy weight can be assigned to the value of a
  tag group where a patient belongs.

### Group Appointment Feature

#### Implementation

The group mechanism implements the following operations:

* Group appointments according to their tags or patient.

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#GroupAppointmentCommand()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `idENTify` will be initialized with the initial
appointment list.

Step 2. The user executes `group appts k/KEY` command to group appointments by their tags `(k/tag)` or patient `(k/patient)`,
causing the modified list of appointments after the `group appts k/KEY` command executes to show on the screen.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("group appts k/KEY")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `group appts k/KEY` Command](images/GroupAppointmentSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/GroupAppointmentCommand.png" width="1000" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How group appointments executes:**

* **Current choice:** Use a different comparator from default so that a heavy weight can be assigned to the value of a
  tag group where a patient belongs or the patient attached to the appointment.

### Ungroup Feature

#### Implementation

The ungroup mechanism implements the following operations:

* Either ungroup appointments or ungroup patients.

The operation is exposed in the `Command` interface as `Command#UngroupCommand()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the group mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `idENTify` will be initialized with the initial
patient and appointment list.

Step 2. The user executes `group appts k/KEY` command to group appointments by their tags `(k/tag)` or patient `(k/patient)`, 
causing the modified list of appointments after the `group appts k/KEY` command executes to show on
the screen or executes `group patients` command to group patients by their tags, causing the modified list of
patients after the `group patients` command executes to show on the screen.

Step 3. The user executes `ungroup appts` command to ungroup appointments or `ungroup patients` command to ungroup
patients.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the use has not group patients or
appointments, ungroup commands will make no effect on the current addressbook list on the screen.
</div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute
("ungroup")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `ungroup` Command](images/UngroupSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/UngroupCommand.png" width="1000" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How ungroup executes:**

* **Current choice:** Use the default comparator for appointments or patients so that the specified list will sort
  as default settings. To be more specific, the patient list will be sorted by patients' names and the appointemnt
  list will be sorted by datetime.

### Book Feature

#### Implementation

The `AddressBookParser` class checks for the `book` command word. The book mechanism is facilitated by the `BookCommandParser` and `BookCommand` classes. The `BookCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and takes in the user input and parses it into an index and 4 string values. The 4 string values are obtained from the `ArgumentMultimap` that checks whether the user has inputted the 4 prefixes supported by this feature.

The prefixes are:
* `r/` for reason
* `d/` for dateTime
* `pe/` for recurring time period (optional)
* `t/` for tags (optional)

After retrieving the string values, the `BookCommandParser` executes the `ParserUtil#ParseAppointment()` to use these values to create an `Appointment` object. A `BookCommand` object will then be created with the given index and `Appointment` object. The `BookCommand` object will retrieve the specified person in the `UniquePersonList` and adds the `Appointment` object to the person's list of appointments.

The newly added `Appointment` object will also be saved in the JSON file through the usage of a Jackson-friendly class `JsonAdaptedAppointment`.

Given below are some example usage scenarios and how the book feature behaves in each scenario.

Scenario 1: User inputs `book 1 r/Sore Throat d/2022-12-10 12:00`.

The `ParserUtil#ParseAppointment()` will detect that both the given reason and date are valid, and creates an appointment object to be stored in the specified `Person`, only if the `Person` does not have an existing appointment at that date(Scenario 6).

Scenario 2: User inputs an empty reason in the `r/` prefix.

The `ParserUtil#ParseAppointment()` will detect that the given reason is empty and throws a `ParseException`, which will feedback to the user that he has given an invalid reason.

Scenario 3: User inputs an invalid dateTime in the `d/` prefix, such as `2022-15-10 14:00`.

The `ParserUtil#ParseAppointment()` will detect that the given dateTime is invalid and throws a `ParseException`, which will feedback to the user that he has given an invalid dateTime.

Scenario 4: User inputs an invalid recurring time period in the `pe/` prefix, such as `1S`.

The `ParserUtil#ParseAppointment()` will detect that the given time period is invalid and throws a `ParseException`, which will feedback to the user that he has given an invalid time period.

Scenario 5: User inputs an invalid tag in the `t/` prefix, such as `Sick`.

The `ParserUtil#ParseAppointment()` will detect that the given tag is invalid and throws a `ParseException`, which will feedback to the user that he has given an invalid tag.

Scenario 6: User tries to book an appointment with the same time as other appointments of the same person.

<img src="images/BookCommandObjectDiagram.png" width="450" />

This object diagram illustrates the above scenario. As the specified person has already booked an appointment in `Dec 10 2022 12:00`, the newly created `Appointment` object will not be associated with the person. The `BookCommand` will throw a `CommandException`, which will feedback to the user that he tried to book an appointment at the same time as the other appointments.

The following sequence diagram helps to provide a clearer picture to how the book operation works:

![BookSequenceDiagram](images/BookSequenceDiagram.png)

The following Class diagram shows how serializing `Appointment` objects into JSON format is done.

<img src="images/BookCommandStorageClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

`Appointment` objects are mapped to `JsonAdaptedAppointment` objects, so that they contain only relevant fields to store and works easier with Jackson.
These objects are stored in a list field of the `JsonAdaptedPerson` and are stored together in a single JSON file, for easier retrival and assignment when starting up the application.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Where to assign Appointment objects:**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Each person stores his own list of appointments, as well as the `UniqueAppointmentList` class storing the same objects.
  * Pros: Easier to keep track of which appointments are associated to which person for other appointment related features.
  * Cons: Must ensure both the person's appointments and `UniqueAppointmentList` appointments are equal, in edit/cancel/delete features.

* **Alternative 2:** `Appointment` objects are stored only in the `UniqueAppointmentList` class.
  * Pros: Easier to maintain as there's only one appointment object.
  * Cons: Harder and more costly to track of each person's appointments, especially if the person himself is edited or deleted in the process.

### Edit Appointment Feature

#### Implementation
The `AddressBookParser` class checks for the `edit` command word and the `appts` descriptor word to begin. The edit appointment mechanism is facilitated by the `EditAppointmentCommandParser`, `EditAppointmentCommand` classes and `EditAppointmentDescriptor` inner class. The `EditAppointmentCommandParser` implements the `Parser` interface and takes in the user input and parses it into an index and up to 4 string values. The string values are obtained from the `ArgumentMultimap` that checks whether the user has inputted any of the 4 prefixes supported by this feature.

The prefixes are:
* `r/` for reason
* `d/` for dateTime
* `pe/` for recurring time period
* `t/` for tags

The logical flow of using this command is shown in the activity diagram given below.

![EditApptActivityDiagram](images/EditApptActivityDiagram.png)

If any of the prefixes contain invalid values or no prefix values were provided, a `ParseException` will be thrown. Else, a new `Appointment` will be created with the changes and replaces the specified `Appointment` object to be edited in both the `Person` list of appointments and the `UniqueAppointmentList`. 

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to edit the appointment objects:**

* **Alternative 1 (current implementation):** Follow the `EditPersonDescriptor` inner class and implement a `EditAppointmentDescriptor` inner class.
  * Pros: Easier to follow existing systems and edit the appointment the same way as the `edit patients` command.
  * Cons: Existing `Appointment` object is no longer used, using memory until garbage collected.

* **Alternative 2:** Edit the existing `Appointment` object itself.
  * Pros: Only have to edit the required fields.
  * Cons: Editing the existing object does not reflect the changes in the Appointment listview as compared to setting a new object, hence requiring more Observable fields.

### Mark/Unmark Feature

#### Implementation

The parameters involved in the `mark`/`unmark` commands is the same as that of the `cancel` command. 
All 3 commands take in a single parameter denoting the desired appointment number to modify. 

As such, the `mark`/`unmark` commands also extend the `SelectAppointmentCommand` class, and are parsed similarly as well -
firstly through the `AddressBookParser` to identify the inputted command as a `mark`/`unmark` command, 
then followed by a second parse in `MarkCommandParser`/`UnmarkCommandParser` to create a `MarkCommand`/`UnmarkCommand` object,
which is then executed to mark/unmark the target appointment.

However, the `mark` command comes with an additional step during the `execute` method. 
It checks if an appointment is recurring, and adds a future unmarked appointment at the designated date if needed.

Given below is an example usage scenario, where the user enters `mark 1` as the input,
and how the `mark` mechanism behaves at each step.

![MarkSequenceDiagram](images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png)

The `unmark` sequence diagram is identical to the `mark` sequence diagram but lacks the `opt` frame.
It also contains the `UnmarkCommandParser` and `UnmarkCommand` classes in place of `MarkCommandParser` and `MarkCommand` respectively.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How mark & unmark executes:**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `MarkCommand` and `UnmarkCommand` takes in an `Index` denoting the appointment to
mark/unmark.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: Will have to compute the actual appointment to mark `MarkCommand`/`UnmarkCommand` itself.

* **Alternative 2:** `MarkCommand` and `UnmarkCommand` takes in the `Appointment` to be marked as a parameter in its
constructor directly
    * Pros: Cohesiveness is increased, as it only needs to concern itself with marking/unmarking the appointment.
    * Cons: The `CommandResult` object generated at the end of the command will not have the `Index` of the appointment
  recorded in it. This makes it harder to debug using `CommandResult` when bugs occur.

### Find Feature

#### Implementation

![MarkSequenceDiagram](images/FindClassDiagram.png)

The `find` command takes in 2 predicates `CombinedPersonPredicate`, `CombinedAppointmentPredicate` and a boolean `isAppointmentPredicateUsed`.
* `CombinedPersonPredicate` stores all person related search strings and tests for all patients that satisfies all
  the search terms.
* `CombinedAppointmentPredicate` stores all appointment related search fields and tests for all appointments that
  satisfies all the search terms.
* `isAppointmentPredicateUsed` tracks if there are any appointment related search terms are specified by the user. 

These 3 fields are generated and supplied by the `FindCommandParser`, which takes in the user inputs during a `find` command, 
and sorts the input into the 2 predicate classes accordingly as shown in the diagram above, 
in addition to also producing the value of `isAppointmentPredicateUsed`.

To facilitate the idea of returning only relevant results to the user, the `execute()` method of `FindCommand` follows a 3-step process.
1. `personFulfillingBothPredicates`, the predicate to display all patients that satisfy the `CombinedPersonPredicate` is generated first. If `isAppointmentPredicateUsed` is `true`,
the predicate is also modified to check if the patient has at least 1 appointment that satisfies the `CombinedAppointmentPredicate`. 
As such, the `isAppointmentPredicateUsed` field ensures  that patients with no appointments are still displayed when a user inputs 
only patient related search parameters.
2. `appointmentFulfillingBothPredicates` is generated next. It is a predicate that displays all appointments that satisfy the `CombinedAppointmentPredicate` with a patient owner that
satisfies the `personFufillingBothPredicates` predicated generated in step 1.
3. To display only results in the current patient and appointment lists shown to the user that satisfies all the search terms,
The 2 predicates generated in step 1 and 2 are combined with the current active predicate in the model.

The logical flow of this command is summarised in the activity diagram below.
![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

Ultimately, this ensures that for an entry to be displayed:
* A patient must satisfy all patient search terms and have at least 1 appointment that satisfies all the appointment search terms, if provided.
* An appointment must satisfy all appointment search terms and belong to a patient that satisfies all the patient search terms.
* The entry must also exist in the list prior to the execution of the find command.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to pass in search terms to `FindCommand`:**
* **Alternative 1:** Store all search terms in `FindCommand` and use `Predicate#and` to combine the
the search predicates.
    * Pros: Easy and quick to implement. No extra classes needed.
    * Cons: Low testability of `FindCommand`. There is no way to override the `Predicate#equals()`, so we will be unable to check if two `Predicate`s have the same search parameters.

* **Alternative 2:** Create 1 class for each search term
(E.g `NameContainsSequencePredicate`, `AppointmentContainsReasonPredicate` etc.). Create a `CombinedPersonPredicate`
and a `CombinedAppointmentPredicate` that takes in all these 'lesser' predicates and combine them to form the actual
predicate to filter the list with. All these classes will be subclasses of `Predicate`.
    * Pros: 
      * Very high testability of `FindCommand`, as we can now override `equals()`.
      * Having separate `CombinedPersonPredicate` and `CombinedAppointmentPredicate` classes would also allow patients and appointments to be tested separately,
enhancing cohesion and decreasing coupling through the Separation of Concerns principle.
    * Cons: 
      * Large amount of classes needed. There would also be the issue of excessive duplication of code. 
      * Time-consuming to add in potential new predicates in the future as much more test cases would be needed
to test each individual class.

* **Alternative 3 (current choice):** Keep the `CombinedPersonPredicate` and `CombinedAppointmentPredicate`,
and store the relevant search terms into each predicate. Combine those search terms in the predicate class itself.
    * Pros: 
      * High testability of `FindCommand`.
      * Extending the method features in the future would be more convenient than alternative 2. 
      * The benefit of being able to separately test patients and appointments as mentioned in alternative 2 is preserved.
    * Cons: Slightly less testable than alternative 2. However, the increased efficiency is worth the tradeoff.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target User Profile:**
* Tech savvy admin staff in Ear, Nose, Throat (ENT) department
* Has a need to manage a significant number of patients/appointments
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Can type fast
* Prefer typing to mouse interactions
* Is reasonably comfortable using Command-Line Interface (CLI) apps

**Value proposition:**
* ENT doctors treat patients who often have chronic conditions and our product will make it easier for the staff to keep track of these patients, such as their appointment dates, the completion status of these appointments, the type of appointment etc
* ENT department offers a lot of services including head & neck surgery, voice clinic, and otology / skull base, etc; therefore, they need this app to filter different types of patients

   1. Expected result: Similar to test case 2, but with appointments instead.

### Hiding/Unhiding results
Section Prerequisite: There is a patient named `Bernice` with at least 1 appointment. There is also at least 1 appointment
in the appointment list with the reason `Checkup`.
It is recommended to have more patients and appointments so that the behaviour of this command becomes more clear.

- **Note**: For all test cases in this section, a message displaying the number of filtered results should appear after every valid input.

   1. Expected result: The results hidden in the previous test case should reappear.

### Finding results
Section Prerequisites: Same prerequisites as those in the previous section `Hiding/Unhiding results`.

**Note**: Enter `list all` after performing every test case in this section. Similarly to the previous section, a message
displaying the number of filtered results should appear after every valid input.

      2. Only patients with at least 1 such appointment will appear in the patient list.

### Dealing with save data issues

1. Test Case: Dealing with missing files
   1. If there is no save data present, the application will open with a new data file filled with sample data
   2. To simulate a missing file:
      1. Head to the location of your save data. The location of the save data is indicated at the bottom left of the idENTify app.
      2. Delete the file `idENTify.json`
      3. Relaunch the app.
   3. Expected result: A new file will be created with some sample patients and appointments.

2. Test case: Dealing with corrupted files
   1. If save data is corrupted, the application will open with an empty data file.
   2. To simulate a missing file:
      1. Head to the location of your save data, in the same way as the previous test case.
      2. Open the file `idENTify.json`, and corrupt the file (E.g. Delete the very first line of the `idENTify.json` file).
      3. Relaunch the app.
   3. Expected result: A new file will be created with no patients or appointments.


## **Appendix: Effort**
Our project was harder than Address Book Level3(AB3) because AB3 only deals with Persons, while our project includes Appointments as well. There was a huge learning curve at the start as we were very unfamiliar with what most of the classes do. After familiarizing ourselves with some of the necessary classes to implement our new enhancements, we also had a hard time writing new test cases as our new features caused the existing test cases to fail. It took a long time for us to figure out that the existing static variables used for the test cases were the problem as our new test cases involved altering the list of appointments in those variables.

In v1.2, we updated the GUI to contain 2 listviews: one for patients and one for appointments. We found out that changes to our appointment fields, such as marking them as completed, were not properly reflected on the listviews. We had to spent time researching how to use the Observer pattern(ie. Callback) to reflect such changes. We also had to differentiate similar commands by using a descriptor word(patients/appts), and spent some time learning regex in order to update the AddressBookParser's pattern checking. As our mark, unmark, edit appts and cancel features also used the same mechanism to retrieve the specified appointment, we had to spent time refactoring our Parser classes to reduce duplication of such code.

In v1.3, we implemented our organisation features: hide, unhide, group, ungroup and find. While they all individually worked as expected, we had a hard time integrating hide/unhide/find to work well together, as these commands all deal with inserting a Predicate into the filtered list. It took some time for us to figure out how to keep track of the current Predicate in each filtered list and to add onto this Predicate while executing any hide/unhide/find command.

Overall, we are satisfied with our project given the time constraints and huge learning curve for the starting weeks. While workload is relatively high, it was an enjoyable experience to be working in a team.
