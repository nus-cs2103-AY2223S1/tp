## **Introduction** 

GuestBook is a **desktop app for managing guests in a hotel,
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI)
while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
The primary target audiences of GuestBook are **hotel mangers of small hotels**, 
such as budget hotels and backpacker's inns, who can type fast.
In summary, GuestBook can accomplish
guest management tasks faster than traditional GUI apps with its efficient
management tools.


GuestBook tracks guests and their details including name, email address, phone number,
room number, dates of stay, number of guests, bill, request, and whether their room has been cleaned.
With features to add, edit, delete, and filter guests, GuestBook fulfills all the essential hotel management needs.

## **Design**

This section aims to showcase how GuestBook was designed. We first go through the **overarching
architecture** of GuestBook, before going into more details about its underlying structure and interactions of
the four core components. The four core components are namely the User Interface (UI), Logic, Model and Storage.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of GuestBook.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/guest/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/guest/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: **to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component**), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/guest/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `GuestListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/guest/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/GuestListPanel.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Guest` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/guest/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `GuestBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g., to add a guest).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `GuestBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `GuestBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/guest/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the GuestBook data i.e., all `Guest` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueGuestBook` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Guest` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an **unmodifiable** `ObservableList<Guest>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/guest/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both GuestBook data and user preference data in **JSON format**, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `GuestBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.guest.commons` package.

An example of a class in `commons` package is `IllegalValueException` class that is thrown when data inputted
does not fulfil a constraint.


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Notable Fields of a Guest**

This section goes in-depth about the design decisions of some fields from the `Guest` class.

### Bill Field

The `Bill` class holds the value that a `Guest` is required to pay to the hotel.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Implementation:</span>

* Its constructor takes in a string representing a signed `double` with up to 2 decimal places.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Design Considerations:</span>

**Aspect: `add()` method of the `Bill` class**
* As `Bill`s can be added to each other, we abstracted this behaviour into the `add` method of `Bill`.

**Aspect: How to deduct from bills**
* **Alternative 1:** Create a `subtract` method in `Bill`.
    * Pros: More understandable code.
    * Cons: Requires knowledge of which method to call (`add` or `subtract`).
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Use `add()` with a negative `Bill`.
    * Pros: Less code, more flexibility.
    * Cons: `Bill` must be allowed to hold negative values, but the bill field for each `Guest`
      cannot, thus requiring more checks.

Taking into consideration that `double`s are already signed and charges on bills can be negative, we decided to proceed with Alternative 2.

### DateRange Field

The `DateRange` class holds the period of stay of a `Guest`.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Implementation:</span>

* Its constructor takes in a string representing a check-in date and a check-out date.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Design Considerations:</span>

**Aspect: How to represent dates**
* **Alternative 1:** Separate classes for check-in and check-out dates extended from a `GuestDate` class.
    * Pros: Easier to parse and edit dates separately.
    * Cons: Depend on each other for validation (check-in must be earlier than check-out), which increases coupling.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Single class representing both dates.
    * Pros: Validation can be done within the class itself which reduces coupling. More intuitive as the dates
      are often displayed together.
    * Cons: Parsing, editing, and other operations on the dates are more complex.

Taking into consideration that check-in and check-out dates come as a pair, we decided to proceed with Alternative 2 to reduce coupling.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Features**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented in GuestBook.

### Adding a Guest
In GuestBook, a user can add a guest using the `add` command. This feature is necessary for hotel operations.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Implementation:</span>
* The `add` command takes in 6 compulsory fields (`name`, `phone`, `email`, `room`, `dateRange` and `numberOfGuests`)
and 1 optional field (`request`) and is supported by the `AddCommandParser` that extracts out each of the fields
from their respective prefixes.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters an `add` command.

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)
* When the user executes an `add` command, the user will fill in the necessary details of the guest.
* If the user specifies a `Request` (i.e., the user entered rq/ in the command line), the guest will be created with a `Request`.
* Else, the details of the guest created will not have an intended value for `Request` specified by the user.
* Finally, the guest is added to the model.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Design Considerations:</span>

**Aspect: How to deal with duplicate entries**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Reject any entry with a duplicate name or room that is case-sensitive.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: Will have issues with adding people of the same name or room to GuestBook.

* **Alternative 2:** Allow duplicate entries to be added with no consequences.
    * Pros: Allows for multiple guests of the same name or room to be added.
    * Cons: Easy to abuse the command intentionally (to break the program) or unintentionally (accidentally). By allowing duplicate rooms, 
the user might allocate the two different guests to the same room.

In small hotels, the chances of getting two guests that have identical full names are
incredibly unlikely. Also, having two different guests allocated to the same room is a rather disastrous mistake and should be avoided. With these considerations in mind, we decided to proceed with Alternative 1.

**Aspect: Excluding `isRoomClean` field in the `add` command**
* As adding a guest will be done during check in, the room should by default be cleaned for the guest to immediately
be able to enter their room. Hence, we chose to exclude `isRoomClean` as it would make the `add` command unnecessarily longer. This enables the user to enter their inputs with greater efficiency.

**Aspect: Excluding `Bill` field in the `add` command**
* As adding a guest will be done during check in, the guest should not have incurred any bill costs yet. Hence, we set
the initial bill to be 0 and chose to exclude `Bill` as it would make the `add` command unnecessarily longer. This enables the user to enter their inputs with greater efficiency.

**Aspect: Making `Request` optional in the `add` command**
* As adding a guest will be done during check in, the guest may or may not have any special requests to make for the room. Hence,
we chose to make `Request` optional and **default its value to a hyphen (`-`)** should it not be provided. This would also reduce the length
of `add` command in the event that there is no request from the guest.


### Billing a Guest
In GuestBook, the user can add to the bill of a guest to track the current expenses incurred by the guest using the `bill` command. This feature was added to help the user track their guests' expenses, without having to manually calculate it each time.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Implementation:</span>
* The `bill` command takes in an `INDEX` indicating the index of the guest to edit in the current panel (starting from 1) and the `bill` field and is supported by the `BillCommandParser` that extracts the bill value.

The following activity diagrams summarizes what happens when a user enters a `bill` command.

![BillActivityDiagram](images/BillActivityDiagram.png)
* When the user executes the `bill` command, GuestBook will find the guest to be billed based on the index passed to the command.
* A new bill will be created with the updated value based on the value passed to the `bill` command.
* A new guest will be created with the updated bill, while the other details of the guest will remain unchanged.
* Finally, the new guest is set to the model.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Design Considerations:</span>

**Aspect: How to update a bill**
* **Alternative 1:** Set the bill to the input value.
  * Pros: Can be implemented by extending the `edit` command, so that the user does not need to learn an additional command.
  * Cons: The user is required to calculate the updated bill value, which is less convenient and intuitive.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Add the input value to the bill.
  * Pros: More aligned with real-life implementation of bills, by adding the next charge. Easy to undo as the result of the previous command is displayed.
  * Cons: Addition method must be implemented, and negative values must be accepted.
* **Alternative 3:** Allow both depending on syntax.
  * Pros: Flexibility for user, such as resetting the bill to 0 or another known value if needed.
  * Cons: Syntax may be confusing and complex to implement.

Taking into consideration the much higher probability of the user using the bill command to add a value as compared to setting the value,
and that minimal calculation is needed to reset the bill to 0 (`b/-CURRENT_VALUE`), we decided to proceed with Alternative 2.

**Aspect: Accepting signed and unsigned positive values**
* As the user may prefer to see the `+` sign to differentiate between positive and negative values, or leave out the `+` sign for convenience, we decided to accept both formats for positive values.

**Aspect: Using the `b/` prefix**
* To standardise the formatting and testing for field inputs, we decided to include the `b/` prefix in the command syntax.

### Editing a Guest's Details

In GuestBook, the user can edit the details of a guest using the `edit` command. Details that do not have values inputted in the `edit` command will remain unchanged.
This feature was implemented so that it is easy for the user to change a guest's details according to different scenarios, such as the changing of a guest's room, or the guest providing incorrect details.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Implementation:</span>
* The `edit` command takes in an `INDEX` indicating the guest to edit in the current panel (starting from 1)
  and 8 optional fields (`name`, `phone`, `email`, `room`, `dateRange`, `numberOfGuests`, `isRoomClean` and `request`)
  and is supported by the `EditCommandParser` that extracts out each of the fields from their respective prefixes.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters an `edit` command.

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)
* When the user executes the `edit` command, GuestBook will find the guest to be edited based on the index passed to the command.
* A new guest will be created with the updated values based on the values passed to the `edit` command. The other details of the guests will remain unchanged.
* Finally, the new guest is set to the model.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Design Considerations:</span>

**Aspect: Allowing only specific fields provided to be edited**
* As the edit command is usually used when there is a change or error in the information provided, it makes more sense for the user to be able to change only selected fields.

**Aspect: Excluding `Bill` in the `edit` command**
* As the `bill` command allows us to add and subtract to the bill directly, the edit command is redundant and
  may cause user error if they were to replace the `Bill` by accident.

### Marking all Rooms as Unclean

In GuestBook, the user can mark all the rooms as unclean. This feature was added to make it easier for the hotel to transit to a new working day, as they would usually have to clean all the rooms when a new day starts.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Implementation:</span>
* The `markroomsunclean` command edits all the guests in GuestBook and changes their `isRoomClean` statuses to `no`. It takes in no additional inputs or fields.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a `markroomsunclean` command.

![MarkRoomsUncleanActivityDiagram](images/MarkRoomsUncleanActivityDiagram.png)
* When the user executes the `markroomsunclean` command, GuestBook will retrieve the list of all the guests in GuestBook.
* A new list of guests will be created with `isRoomClean` fields set to `no`. The other details of the guests will remain unchanged.
* Finally, the new list of guests is set to the model.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Design Considerations:</span>


**Aspect: The scope at which the command changes all guests' `isRoomClean` statuses**
* **Alternative 1:** Allow `markroomsunclean` command to operate only on the last shown list instead of the entire guest list. This is to standardise how edits are made across the commands (e.g., `edit` and `delete`).
  * Pros: This might be more intuitive for users, as `edit` and `delete` commands work only on the last shown lists.
  * Cons: User is unable to change all the guests' `isRoomClean` statuses in a single command.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Allow `markroomsunclean` command to change all guests' `isRoomClean` statuses in GuestBook instead of the last shown list.
  * Pros: User is able to change all the guests' `isRoomClean` statuses in a single command. This improves efficiency for users.
  * Cons: There is less flexibility in marking groups of guests' rooms as unclean.

Taking into consideration that GuestBook is intended for small hotels, it is unlikely 
to have a case in which the user has to mark different groups of guests' `isRoomClean` statuses 
differently as the rooms are usually of the same type. Hence, we decided to proceed with Alternative 2.

**Aspect: Naming of the `markroomsunclean` command**

* **Alternative 1:** Using camel case for the command, i.e., `markRoomsUnclean`.
  * Pros: Better readability of the command for the user.
  * Cons: Takes a longer time to type and there may be a higher chance of typing the wrong command due to the capitalisation of the letters.
* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Using lowercase for the command, i.e., `markroomsunclean`.
  * Pros: Faster and easier to type, lesser chance of typing the wrong command due to consistent lowercasing of letters. It is also consistent with lowercasing of all the other commands, thus the
  commands have greater standardisation.
  * Cons: Might be harder to read the command.

Taking into consideration how GuestBook is optimised for fast-typist, we prefer if the command could be typed faster with lesser chance of mistakes. The readability of the command is also
rather insignificant as once the user gets acquainted with the command, reading it would not be a problem.

### Finding Guests

In GuestBook, the user can find guests using the `find` command. The extensibility of this `find` feature makes it easy for the user to locate guests in GuestBook.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Implementation:</span>
* The `find` command takes in multiple search terms separated by spaces, and finds all guests whose fields contain **any** of the search terms. The search terms are **case-insensitive** as well. For example, finding 'Alice' is the same as finding 'aLiCE'.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user enters a `find` command.

![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)
* When the user executes the `find` command, GuestBook will find guests matching any of the search terms passed by the user in the `find` command.
* Once the finding process is complete, the guests that match any of the search terms will be set to the model.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Design Considerations:</span>

**Aspect: Allowing searching through all fields**
* As the user would usually appreciate the ability to search by other fields such as by `room`, it is appropriate to make the `find` command search through all the fields of the guests.

**Aspect: Only matching full keywords**
* The `find` command only matches full keywords (e.g., typing in 'ali' would **not** match a guest named 'Alice'). As we do not want to display irrelevant data to the hotel manager, we decided to limit the `find` command to only full keywords, so that the results displayed are more targeted.

**Aspect: Implementing `find` command without prefixes**
* In order to increase the productivity of the user, we do not wish for the user to have to type in the prefix, as there is a low probability that the values for the prefixes overlap in a small hotel.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/Redo Feature

As there could be the possibility that the user input the wrong commands, or want to revert to older states, being able to undo or redo is a feature that will be implemented in future iterations of GuestBook.

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Proposed Implementation:</span>

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedGuestBook`. It extends `GuestBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `guestBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedGuestBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current GuestBook state in its history.
* `VersionedGuestBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous GuestBook state from its history.
* `VersionedGuestBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone GuestBook state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitGuestBook()`, `Model#undoGuestBook()` and `Model#redoGuestBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedGuestBook` will be initialized with the initial GuestBook state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single GuestBook state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th guest in GuestBook. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitGuestBook()`, causing the modified state of GuestBook after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `guestBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted GuestBook state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new guest. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitGuestBook()`, causing another modified GuestBook state to be saved into the `guestBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitGuestBook()`, so the GuestBook state will not be saved into the `guestBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the guest was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoGuestBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous GuestBook state, and restores the GuestBook to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial GuestBook state, then there are no previous GuestBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoGuestBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoGuestBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores GuestBook to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `guestBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest GuestBook state, then there are no undone GuestBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoGuestBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify GuestBook, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitGuestBook()`, `Model#undoGuestBook()` or `Model#redoGuestBook()`. Thus, the `guestBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitGuestBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `guestBookStateList`, all GuestBook states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

<span style="font-size: large; color: #e46c0a">Design Considerations:</span>

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire GuestBook.
  * Pros: Easier to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the guest being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

As the users of this application would be hotel mangers of small hotels, there would not a massive list of guests. Hence, we think that memory usage would not be an issue, and proceeded with Alternative 1.

### Editing a guest

Prerequisite: Only 1 guest to be edited. The guest's index should exist.
   The guest should exist in GuestBook. The format and content of the command should be valid.
   The updated `name` and `room` values of the guest to be edited should not be the same as other guests in GuestBook.

   1. Test case: `edit 1 n/Johnny`<br>

   2. Test case: `markroomunclean`<br>
      Expected: No guest's room clean status is changed. The command is invalid as it is missing a "s" after the "room".
   3. Test case: `markRoomsUnclean`<br>
      Expected: No guest's room clean status is changed. The command is invalid as it capitalised the "R" and "U" when they should have been lower case.

### Changing guest's bill value

Prerequisite: Only one guest's bill will be edited.
The guest should exist in GuestBook. The format and content of the command should be valid.
The bill value cannot exceed 999,999,999,999.99.
The test cases must be executed in succession as stated below for the intended outcome.

We assume that there is only one guest in the list.

   1. Test case: `bill 1 b/10`
      Expected: The bill for the first guest in the current list will be incremented by 10.
   2. Test case: `bill 1 b/-10`
      Expected: The bill for the first guest in the current list will be decremented by 10.
   3. Test case: `bill 2 b/10`

   4. Test case: `bill 1 b/9999999999999`
      Expected: No guest's bill is edited, because **the bill value exceeds 999,999,999,999.99**. Error details shown in the result display.
   5. Test case: `bill 1 b/-10`
      Expected: No guest's bill is edited, because the total bill value **cannot be negative**. Error details shown in the result display.

### Clearing all guests from GuestBook
Prerequisite: all guests in GuestBook will be deleted.
This command is irreversible.

   1. Test case: `clear`
      Expected: All guests in GuestBook will be deleted.

### Saving data

Dealing with corrupted data files

   1. A possible cause of a corrupted file could be because of duplicate `name` and/or `room` in the data of the Guest.
   2. While GuestBook throws an exception when a user tries to add a guest with duplicate `name` and/or `room`, a developer
   can circumvent this by changing the data in the `guestbook.json` file directly. 
   3. Similarly, to fix this corrupted file you could either:
      1. Delete the entire `guestbook.json` file and launch the application again, which will automatically create a new `guestbook.json` data file.
      2. Locate the guest entries with duplicate `name` and/or `room` and change them to be unique.
