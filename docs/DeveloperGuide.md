### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The architecture diagram given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

#### Main Components of the Architecture

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/swift/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/swift/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,

- initializing the components in the correct sequence and connecting them up with each other during the app's launch.
- shutting down the components and invoking cleanup methods where necessary when closing the app.

The rest of the app consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): Displays the user interface of the app.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): Parses and executes the commands.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the app in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple components.

#### How the architecture components interact with each other

The sequence diagram below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete_contact 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its API in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class. Other components interact with a given component through its interface, rather than the concrete class. The reasoning is to prevent outside component's from being coupled to the implementation of a component, which is illustrated by the diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI Component

The API of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/swift/ui/Ui.java).

Here's a partial class diagram of the `UI` component without any of the task/contact management panels.

![Structure of the UI Component without Panels](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts, e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter`, and etc. All these parts, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

Here's another partial class diagram of the `UI` component with the task and contact management panels.

![Structure of the UI Component with Panels](images/UiPanelsClassDiagram.png)

The UI keeps track of which tab the user is currently viewing with the `isContactTabShown` boolean. If the contacts tab is currently in view, `MainWindow` contains `PersonListPanel` and `PersonTaskListPanel`, and it contains `TaskListPanel` and `TaskPersonListPanel` if otherwise.

The `UI` component uses the [JavaFx](https://openjfx.io/) UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/swift/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- prompts users with command suggestions and allows them to auto-complete them using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` and `Task` objects located in the `Model`.

### Logic Component

The API of this component is specified in [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/swift/logic/Logic.java).

Here's a partial class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddContactCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete_contact 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete_contact 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note** <br>
The lifeline for `DeleteContactCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`)
- The `XYZCommandParser` class then uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddContactCommand`), which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
- All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddContactCommandParser`, `DeleteTaskCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface, so that they can be treated similarly where possible, e.g. during testing.

### Model Component

The API of this component is specified in [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/swift/model/Model.java).

Here's a partial class diagram of the `Model` component:

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note** <br>
The `Task` and `PersonTaskBridge` classes are left out of the above diagram for simplicity. Compared to the `Person` class, they follow a similar structure of attribute composition.
</div>

The `Model` component,

- stores the address book data, i.e. all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` object.
- does not depend on any of the other three components, because the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, and they should make sense on their own without depending on other components.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note** <br>
An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage Component

The API of this component is specified in [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T12-2/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/swift/storage/Storage.java).

Here's a partial class diagram of the `Storage` component:

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both address book data and user preference data in `.json` format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
- inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component, because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`.

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `swift.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Many-to-many relationship between `Person` and `Task`

The implementation of the contact-task relation is facilitated by `PersonTaskBridge` and `PersonTaskBridgeList`.

`PersonTaskBridge` is a class containing a `Person` UUID and a `Task` UUID, representing a relation between a `Person` and a `Task`.

`PersonTaskBridgeList` is a class containing a list of `PersonTaskBridge` objects, representing all the relations between `Person` and `Task` objects in the `AddressBook`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

- `PersonTaskBridgeList#add(PersonTaskBridge)` - Saves a new relation between a `Person` and a `Task` in the list.
- `PersonTaskBridgeList#remove(PersonTaskBridge)` - Removes an existing relation between a `Person` and a `Task` from the list.
- `PersonTaskBridgeList#removePerson(Person)` and `PersonTaskBridgeList#removeTask(Task)` - Removes all existing relations between a `Person` and `Task` objects from the list.

These operations will be exposed in the `Model` interface.

The following class diagram summarizes the relationship between `PersonTaskBridge` and other classes:

<img src="images/PersonTaskBridgeDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How `Person` and `Task` are associated with `PersonTaskBridge`**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Stores `Person` and `Task` UUID in `PersonTaskBridge`.

  - Pros: No need to handle the case of changing index when `Person` or `Task` are filtered. Easier to maintain data integrity.
  - Cons: Requires changes in `Person` and `Task` schema and storage.

- **Alternative 2:** Stores `Person` and `Task` index in `PersonTaskBridge`.
  - Pros: No change is needed for `Person` and `Task` schema.
  - Cons: Requires changes to `PersonTaskBridge` objects every time a command changes `Person` or `Task` object index.

### Optional `Description` and `Deadline` Fields

The `Description` and `Deadline` fields for tasks are optional for the users fill in. The implementation of this optionality is 
facilitated by wrapping the values using the [`java.util.Optional<T>`](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/docs/api/java.base/java/util/Optional.html) class. 
By doing so, we took advantage of the provided methods, e.g. `orElse`, `or`, and etc. This `Optional` class thus helps to encapsulate
the logic of methods that depend on the presence or absence of the contained value.

#### Difference from Optional `Tag`

It is also optional for a `Person` to have tags. To achieve this, a `Person` stores the tags in a `HashSet`.
If no tags are assigned to a `Person`, the `HashSet` will be empty. By doing so, a `Person` can have any number of tags.

This differs from the implementation of optionality for `Description` and `Deadline`. For `Description` and `Deadline`,
a `Task` can either contain the value or no value at all. Thus, due to the differing multiplicities, we could not use the 
same implementation as tags.

### View Task Details

The implementation of the task tab UI is facilitated by `TaskCard` and `TaskListPanel`.

`TaskCard` and `TaskListPanel` extends the superclass `UiPart<Region>` and fills the UI container with a panel that displays the list of tasks, along with their assigned contacts and deadlines.

`TaskListPanel` in is responsible for displaying the graphics of a task using a `TaskCard`.

### Command Suggestions and Command Auto-Completion

The implementation of Command Suggestions and Command Auto-Completion is facilitated by `CommandSuggestor` in the `Logic` Component. The `CommandBox` UI component listens for changes in the command box textField and calls methods from `CommandSuggestor` to reflect command suggestions and allow autocompletion.

`CommandSuggestor` mainly implements the following operations:

- `CommandSuggestor#suggestCommand` - Suggests a command with the corresponding syntax based on the user's current input
- `CommandSuggestor#autocompleteCommand` - Completes the current user input according to the shown command suggestion

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How to provide command suggestions to users**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Provide command suggestion over the command box.

  - Pros: Uses less screen real estate
  - Cons: Only able to view one possible command

- **Alternative 2:** Provide command suggestions in a separate display box
  itself.
  - Pros: Able to display all possible commands
  - Cons: Uses more screen real estate

**Aspect: How to autocomplete commands for users**

- **Alternative 1:** Autocomplete up to next prefix according displayed command suggestion.

  - Pros: Users can easily autocomplete the command shown with just one tab
  - Cons: Users might have to backspace and complete the command again for commands with common prefixes. Eg. `add_contact`, `add_task`

- **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Autocomplete up to the longest matching prefix of all possible commands.
  - Pros: Easy to autocomplete commands with common prefixes
  - Cons: Users might have to type a few characters more
