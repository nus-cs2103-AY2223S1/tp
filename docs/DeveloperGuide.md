### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Person` references. This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="600" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="850" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Lesson plan feature

#### Implementation

The lesson plan feature allows the user to keep track of a lesson plan for a person in the form of a string. It is a required parameter when a new person is added, through `AddCommandParser`.

It can also be added independently, and is facilitated by `LessonPlanCommand` in the Logic component. It extends `Commmand` with a `LessonPlan` object stored internally.
`LessonPlanCommand` is created by `LessonPlanCommandParser` which implements `Parser<LessonPlanCommand>`.
Each `Person` has a `LessonPlan` object which contains a string value with the Lesson Plan.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the lesson plan feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The address book will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `lessonplan 1 lp/Biology` to overwrite the lesson plan of the first person in the address book.

The following sequence shows how adding a lesson plan works:

![LessonPlanSequenceDiagram](images/LessonPlanSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note** The lifeline for `LessonPlanCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Homework Feature

#### Implementation

The homework feature is facilitated by `HomeworkList` and `Homework`.
Each `Person` has a `HomeworkList` which contains multiple `Homework` objects. Below is a partial class diagram of the relationship:

![HomeworkClassDiagram](images/HomeworkClassDiagram.png)

`HomeworkList` implements the following operations:

* `HomeworkList#addHomework(Homework)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a homework task to the homework list.
* `HomeworkList#editAtIndex(Index)`â€‰â€”â€‰Replaces the homework at the given index with a new homework.
* `HomeworkList#clearList()`â€‰â€”â€‰Deletes all items in the homework list.

These operations are exposed in command executions such as `HomeworkCommand#execute()` and `EditCommand#createEditedPerson()`.
`HomeworkList#clearList()` is used for testing purposes only.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the adding homework mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The address book will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `homework 1 h/Maths worksheet` to add homework to the first person in the address book.
The `homework` command calls `HomeworkList#addHomework(Homework)` and adds the task to the list.

The following sequence shows how adding homework works:

![HomeworkSequenceDiagram](images/HomeworkSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note** The lifeline for `HomeworkCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Step 3. The user decides to edit the homework to Science instead of Maths.
They go into full view mode with the `view` command and execute `edit 1 h/Science worksheet`, which calls `HomeworkList#editAtIndex()` and replaces the old description with the new one.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Format of homework command:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Command prefix required.
    * Pros: Easy to implement. Consistent with formats of other commands.
    * Cons: May seem redundant to type as it can only add one item.

* **Alternative 2:** Command prefix not required.
    * Pros: Saves time for users during input.
    * Cons: May be harder to implement. Inconsistent with formats of other commands.

### Grade Progress Feature

#### Implementation

The grade progress feature is facilitated by `GradeProgressCommand`, `GradeProgress` and `GradeProgressList` classes.
`GradeProgressCommand` extends `Command` abstract class that has  abstract method, `execute()`.
`GradeProgress` deals with the actual grade progress inputs while the
`GradeProgressList` deals with the list of `GradeProgress`. 
The `GradeProgressList` is the object that is displayed in the `AddressBook`.
Additionally, the classes implement the following operations:
- `GradeProgressList#addGradeProgress(GradeProgress)` - Adds grade progress to the grade progress list.
- `GradeProgressList#clearList()` - Clears all stored grades of the Person
- `GradeProgressList#editAtIndex(index)` - Edits the grade at the given index with the new given grade.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the grade progress feature behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the sample data.

Step 2. The user executes `grade 1 g/Math: B` command to insert the grade, `Math: B` to the 1st `Person`'s `GradeProgressList` in the `AddressBook`.
The `GradeProgress` command calls `GradeProgress#addGradeProgress(GradeProgress)` and adds the task to the list.

Step 3. Upon successful entry of grade inputs, the `CommandResult()` message will be invoked.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How grade progress command executes**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creates a new `Person` object and overwrites current 'Person' object
  - Pros: Easy to implement and simple understandable code.
  - Cons: May lead to performance issues, when contents of the `Person` object is greater.
- **Alternative 2:**  Include grade progress to the current 'Person' object with a setter method
  - Pros: Faster, as there is no need to recreate the whole `Person` object
  - Cons: Implementation details are greatly exposed, damages code's maintainability

**Aspect: Addition of Grade progress**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Creation of `Person` object first with empty `GradeProgressList` and thereafter executing `GradeProgressCommand`
  - Pros: Users would not have to key in a long statement when adding a new `Person` to the `AddressBook`
  - Cons: 2 command lines to be written for addition of new `Person` with non-empty `GradeProgressList`
- **Alternative 2:** Grade progress to be added during the creation of the new object
  - Pros: Reduce the need to recreate new `Person` object for the addition of grade progress
  - Cons: Increase tendency of user-made errors when inputting longer command lines

**Aspect: Data Structure of `GradeProgressList`**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** ArrayList
  - Pros: Easy to perform basic functions such as add, delete and remove of respective grade progress elements in the list.
  - Cons: Deletion of data from the middle is time-consuming as data needs to be shifted to update the list.
- **Alternative 2:** Singly Linked list
  - Pros: Insertion and deletion are easier in the linked list. There is no need to shift elements after the insertion or deletion of any element only the address present in the next pointer needs to be updated.
  - Cons: More memory is required in the linked list as compared to an array.

The following sequence diagram shows how the grade progress command operation works:

![GradeProgressSequenceDiagram](images/GradeProgressSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note** The lifeline for `GradeProgressCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Session feature

#### Implementation

The Session feature allows users of Pupilist to keep track of the session day and start timing of their students represented by the Person class. The Sessions of each student is implemented such that they are stored internally as a `Session List` specific to each Person.

The `Session` class implements the `Session` Objects to be stored in the `SessionList` and implements the `Comparator<Session>` Java interface to allow for comparison between `Session instances`.
It encapsulates the exact string input by the user that is to be used by the `Session` class to create the instance of `Session`. It also uses `LocalDateTime` class to encapsulate the `time` attribute 
associated to each instance of the class. The `Session` class uses the format `EEE HH:mm` for the `LocalDateTimeFormatter` to be used to format the string input to instantiate the `time` attribute.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** Due to `LocalDateTimeFormatter` requiring enough information to create a `LocalDateTime` instance, the implementation of `Session` is such that the `LocalDateTimeFormatter` will default to its `ChronoField.YEAR` to be 2000, its `ChronoField.MONTH` be 1 and `ChronoField.ALIGNED_WEEK_OF_MONTH` be 1, as a workaround around this issue.

</div>

Additionally, it implements the following operations:
* `Session#isValidSession(String test)` - Checks whether the string passed by the user is in the valid format to create a `Session` Object.
* `Session#isValidDay(String test)` - Checks whether the day component of the string passed by the user is a valid day of the `LocalDateTime` class. It is a helper method for `isValidSession(String test)`
* `Session#toString()` - The specific String representation for the `Session` Object.
* `Session#equals(Object other)` - Compares a `Session` object to an object, only returning true when the other Object is an instance of `Session` with the specified equality checks with the 'this' `Session` object.
* `Session#compareTo(Session other)` - Compares two instance of the `Session` class for the sorting of `Session` objects in the `SessionList`.
* `Session#hashCode()` - Provides the hashcode of the `Session` Object instance.

Below is the Activity diagram showing how a `Session` instance is created upon the `Session` class constructor being called.

![How a `Session` instance is called upon `Session` constructor being called](images/SessionActivity.png)

These operations are exposed in the `Command` interface through the `SessionCommand` class, the `EditPersonDescriptor` class and `SessionList` class.

Below is the partial class diagram aimed at showing the dependencies of the `Session` class with other classes of the Pupilist code base.

![Dependencies of the `Session` class with other classes](images/SessionDependency.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Session class behaves at each step.

**Assumption: There are `Person` instances of the name Benson Meier and Alice Pauline `Person` list.**


Step 1. The user executes a `view benson meier` command which puts the `Person` with the name Benson Meier in view mode. Assume that the Person has a `SessionList` of size >= 3.

Step 2. The user executes an `edit s/1 Mon 08:30` command which edits the index 0 of the `SessionList` displayed on the GUI. This creates a new Session instance with the string input of the format `EEE HH:mm`.
		The `Session` instances in the `SessionList` of the `Person` is immediately sorted using the `Session` class `compareTo` implementation.

Step 3. The user executes a `session 1 s/ Tue 09:00` command which creates a new instance of `Session` with the string input of the format `EEE HH:mm` and adds it to the `SessionList` of the `Person` of the first Person Card shown in the GUI.
	The `Session` instances in the modified `SessionList` of the `Person` is immediately sorted using the `Session` class `compareTo` implementation.
	
Step 4. The user executes a `view Alice Pauline` command which puts the `Person` with the name Alice Pauline in view mode.

Step 5. The user executes a `remove s/3` command which removes the instance of `Session` in index 2 of the `SessionList` of the `Person` (since SessionList implementation uses zero-based indexing) displayed in the GUI in view mode. The Session 
	instances in the `SessionList` of the `Person` in view are then immediately sorted using the `Session` class `compareTo` implementation.
		
#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How to encapsulate user input in Session**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use defaulting of `LocalDateTimeFormatter` as formatter for `LocalDateTime`.
  * Pros: Easier to implement, uses only one imported Java class `LocalDateTime` for encapsulating user input.
  * Cons: Have to default to a *Black Box* year, month and week which is a workaround. 

* **Alternative 2:** Use of extra `DayOfWeek` class alongside `LocalDateTime`.
  * Pros: Less of a workaround. More accurate backstage representation of user input.
  * Cons: Harder to implement. Have to concatenate `DayOfWeek` and `LocalDateTime` in `toString` method, which may affect performance with a large `SessionList`.

### Attendance Feature

#### Implementation

The attendance feature is facilitated by `AttendanceCommand`, `AttendanceList` and `AttendanceList` classes.
`AttendanceCommand` extends `Command` abstract class that has  abstract method, `execute()`.
`Attendance` deals with the actual attendance inputs while the
`AttendanceList` deals with the list of `Attendance`.
The `AttendanceList` is the object that is displayed in the `AddressBook`.
Additionally, the classes implement the following operations:
- `AttendanceList#addAttendance(Attendance)` - Adds attendance to the attendance list.
- `AttendanceList#clearList()` - Clears all stored attendance of the Person
- `AttendanceList#editAtIndex(index)` - Edits the attendance at the given index with the new given attendance.

These operations are exposed in command executions such as `AttendanceCommand#execute()` and `EditCommand#createEditedPerson()`.
`Attendance#clearList()` is used for testing purposes only.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the adding attendance mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The address book will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `attendance 1 a/2022-08-08` to add attendance to the first `Person`'s attendance list in the address book.
The `Attendance` command calls `AttendanceList#addAttendance(Attendance)` and adds the task to the list.

The following sequence shows how adding attendance works:

![AttendanceSequenceDiagram](images/AttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note** The lifeline for `AttendanceCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Step 3. The user decides to edit the attendance to 2022-08-12 instead.
They go into full view mode with the `view` command and execute `edit 1 a/2022-08-12`, which calls `AttendanceList#editAtIndex()` and replaces the old description with the new one.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Format of user input in Attendance**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use `LocalDate` to encapsulate user input into a `Session`.
    * Pros: Easier to implement, uses only one imported Java class `LocalDate` for encapsulating user input and intuitive for user.
    * Cons: Cannot differentiate between `Session` timings on the same day. Hence, a `Person` who has two `Session` on the same day, who is present for one or the other cannot be differentiated. 

* **Alternative 2:** Use of `LocalDateTime` instead of `LocalDate`.
    * Pros: Able to differentiate `Attendance` between two `Session` timings on the same day.
    * Cons: Longer user input. This results in longer user input every time the user adds an `Attendance` to a `Person`. May result in cumulative inconvenience over a long period of time. Can be solved by initial implementation by adding two `Attendance`.

### Remove feature

#### Implementation

The remove feature allows the user to remove a specified detail from the homework, session, attendance, or grade progress lists. It can only be used when the user is in the 'view' state of the student.

Remove is facilitated by the `RemoveCommand` in the Logic component. It extends `command`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the Remove mechanism behaves at each step.

**Assumption: There are `Person` instances of the name Benson Meier in the `Person` list.**

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the sample data and
each person in the `AddressBook` contains details for each `GradeProgress`, `Session`, `Attendance` or `Homework` object.
Step 2. The user executes `view Benson Meier`,bringing the user to the `view state` of Benson Meier
Step 3. The user executes a `remove a/3` command. The following methods are called in the given order:
1. `LogicManager#Execute`, which then calls
2. `AddressBookParser#parseCommand`. It will parse the input as a `RemoveCommand` and call the constructor of `RemoveCommandParser`.
3. `RemoveCommandParser#parse` will parse the user command based on the prefixes given by the user, and returns a `RemoveCommand` with `RemovePersonDescriptor` as input.
4. `RemoveCommand#execute` is called, and it will check if the user is in `view state`. If not, it will throw a `CommandException` with `MESSAGE_NOT_VIEW_MODE`. Otherwise, the method continues to run.
5. The `RemoveCommand#createRemovedPerson` creates a person using the information in the `RemovePersonDescriptor`.
6. The `Person` is replaced by the newly created `Person` using `Model#setPerson`. `RemoveCommand#execute` returns a `CommandResult` to the `LogicManager`.

The following activity diagram summarises what happens when a user executes the Remove command:

![RemoveSequenceDiagram](images/RemoveSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note** The lifeline for `RemoveCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Where to implement Remove function**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have a dedicated function for removing specified details of a Person from the various lists in their details. 
  * Pros: Easier to implement
  * Cons: Less intuitive, users must know difference between `edit` and `remove` functions

* **Alternative 2:** Integrate remove function into edit function.
  * Pros: More intuitive as removing a feature is also instinctively understood as editing details. 
  * Cons: Harder to implement, can lead to potential errors if user means to edit as opposed to remove 

* **Alternative 3:** No Remove command. Users are unable to remove fields added to student's lists, and have to edit the existing fields instead.
  * Pros: Less bug-prone, more convenient for developers
  * Cons: Not user-friendly and makes things difficult for users.
  
### Mark & Unmark Feature

#### Implementation

The `mark` feature allows the user to mark a specified item from the homework or attendance list.
The `unmark` feature allows the user to unmark a specified item from the homework or attendance list.
Both `mark` and `unmark` features can only be used when the user is in the `view` state of the student.

The `mark` feature is facilitated by `MarkCommand` and `MarkPersonDescriptor` which is an associated class.
The `unmark` feature is faciliatated by `UnmarkCommand` and `MarkPersonDescriptor` which is an associated class.
Each `MarkCommand` and `UnmarkCommand` contains one and only one `MarkPersonDescriptor` object. Below is a partial class diagram of the relationship.

![MarkCommandClassDiagram](images/MarkCommandClassDiagram.png)


Both `MarkCommand` and `UnmarkCommand` extends `Command` abstract class that has  abstract method, `execute()`.
`MarkPersonDescriptor` class stores the details to mark/unmark the person with.

Additionally, the classes implement the following methods
- `MarkCommmand#createMarkedPerson` - creates a person object with marked field as specified by the command.
- `MarkCommand#getUpdatedHomeworkList` - creates an updated homework list.
- `MarkCommand#getUpdatedAttendanceList` - creates an updates attendance list.

To enable the marking behaviour, following methods have been implemented
- `Attendance#markAsPresent` - sets the `isPresent` attribute as `true`
- `AttendanceList#markAtIndex` - sets the `isPresent` attribute of the object in the list specified by the index as `true`
- `Homework#markAsDone` - sets the `isDone` attribute as `true`
- `HomeworkList#markAtIndex` - sets the `isDone` attribute of the object in the list specified by the index as `true`

To enable the unmarking behaviour, following methods have been implemented
- `Attendance#markAsAbsent` - sets the `isPresent` attribute as `false`
- `AttendanceList#unmarkAtIndex` - sets the `isPresent` attribute of the object in the list specified by the index as `false`
- `Homework#markAsUndone` - sets the `isDone` attribute as `false`
- `HomeworkList#unmarkAtIndex` - sets the `isDone` attribute of the object in the list specified by the index as `false`

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the user can mark a specified item from the homework or attendance list.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `view Alex Yeoh`, which would show the details of the person only.

Step 3. The user executes `mark h/1`, which would then mark the homework of index 1 in `Alex Yeoh`'s homework list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `MarkCommand` works:

![MarkSequenceDiagram](images/MarkSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note** The lifeline for `MarkCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How mark and unmark command executes**
- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Use of PersonDescriptors for identifying and marking/unmarking of fields
  - Pros: Able to identify the various 2 fields and do the necessary updates where needed
  - Cons: More code to implement which would mean it is more susceptible to bugs
- **Alternative 2:** Do direct marking of lists through invoking of marking methods of the specified field
  - Pros: Less bug-prone, easier to implement
  - Cons: Marking/unmarking might be limited to only one field


### Schedule feature

#### Implementation

The session feature is facilitated by `ShowCommand` and `TimeSlot` which is an association class. Each `TimeSlot` contains a `Person` and a `Session`.
Below is a partial class diagram of the relationship:

![TimeSlotClassDiagram](images/TimeSlotClassDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario of how the user can view the schedule by day:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `session 1 s/Mon 12:30`, adding a session time to the first person in the list.

Step 3. The user executes a `show Mon` command which displays a list of persons with sessions on Monday.

The following sequence shows how viewing the schedule works:

![ShowSequenceDiagram](images/ShowSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note** The lifeline for `ShowCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Retrieval of individual sessions**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** An association class between `Session` and `Person`
  * Pros: Simple to retrieve a `Person` and a `Session` when bound together
  * Cons: Association has to be explicitly added and created when needed instead of existing throughout
* **Alternative 2:** Bidirectional navigability
  * Pros: Easy to identify the corresponding `Person` for each `Session`
  * Cons: Increases coupling

**Aspect: Populating of `TimeSlot` objects**
* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Populated and retrieved only when user inputs `show`
  * Pros: Lesser things to store and keep track of, easier to implement
  * Cons: Has to iterate through the list multiple times if user enters the command multiple times without making changes to the session timings
* **Alternative 2:** Global list that gets updated each time a session changes
  * Pros: Easy to retrieve list of time slots
  * Cons: Unnecessary storing as it only depends on `Session` and `Person` which are both already stored, have to constantly update whenever `SessionList` is updated.


### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedAddressBook`. It extends `AddressBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `addressBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedAddressBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current address book state in its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous address book state from its history.
* `VersionedAddressBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone address book state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` and `Model#redoAddressBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single address book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th person in the address book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing the modified state of the address book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `addressBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted address book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`, causing another modified address book state to be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, so the address book state will not be saved into the `addressBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoAddressBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous address book state, and restores the address book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial AddressBook state, then there are no previous AddressBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoAddressBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the address book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `addressBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest address book state, then there are no undone AddressBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoAddressBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the address book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitAddressBook()`, `Model#undoAddressBook()` or `Model#redoAddressBook()`. Thus, the `addressBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitAddressBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `addressBookStateList`, all address book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire address book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.
