## **Overview**

TruthTable is a **desktop app for managing software engineering teams, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface**
(CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 

This Developer Guide will help you get familiar with the architecture of TruthTable and understand the design choices 
and implementations of key features in TruthTable, in case you are interested in contributing to this project.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The **_Architecture Diagram_** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It
is responsible for,

- At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
- At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

- [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
- [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
- [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
- [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The _Sequence Diagram_ below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete person 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

- defines its _API_ in an `interface` with the same name as the component.
- implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point).

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside components being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

The classes are related to each other as such:

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

For the sake of readability and understanding, the classes related to `TeamListPanel` and `TaskDetailsPanel` have been omitted in the above diagram. They have been extracted out in a separate diagram as follows:

![Structure of the Teams Component of UI](images/UiTeamsClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter`, `TeamListPanel`, `TeamDetailsPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

- executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
- listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
- keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component. For example, the `PersonListPanel` displays the `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TruthTableParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddPersonCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete person 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (some of which omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** The classes in Orange above are provided by picocli. For more info, check out the
[picocli documentation page](https://picocli.info/).
</div>

How the parsing works:

- When called upon to parse a user command, the `TruthTableParser` class calls the static method `tokenize` from 
  `ArgumentTokenizer`, which will split a string into a string array of tokens `args` (inspired by the 
  [Shell Command Language](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_03), 
  a string is split into space-separated strings, except for quoted strings which will remain as a single token, 
  e.g. `token1 "token 2" token-3` will be read as 3 separate tokens `token1`, `token 2`, `token-3`).
- The `TruthTableParser` class passes `args` to the `CommandLine` class provided by picocli, which will parse the  
  command `XYZComnand` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command e.g. `DeletePersonCommand`), converting any
  arguments from strings to specific types using `ABCConverter` (`ABC` is a placeholder for the type argument e.g. 
 `IndexConverter` since `DeletePersonCommand` takes in an integer as an `Index`).
- All `ABCConverter` classes (e.g., `IndexConverter`, `NameConverter`, `EmailConverter` ...) extend the 
  `CommandLine.IConverter` interface to be utilized by picocli.

### Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png"/>

The `Model` component,

- stores the TruthTable data i.e., all `Person` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object) and `Team`
  objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTeamList` object) each of which containing `Task`, `Link` and `Person`
  objects (see the section below regarding `Team`).
- stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Team` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which
  is exposed to other classes as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<T>` where `T` is either `Person` or `Team` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to
  this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
- stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
- does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

Each `Team` object,

- stores a list of `Task` objects (in a `TaskList` object), list of team members (`Person` objects in a 
  `UniquePersonList` object) and `Link` objects (in a `UniqueLinkList`).
- exposes a list of `Person` or `Task` objects as a `DisplayList<T>`, which itself contains a `FilteredList<T>` (where 
  `T` refers to either `Person` or `Task`). This `FilteredList` will store a 'filtered' view on the data (e.g., results 
  of a search query) sorted in a particular manner. It can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that 
  the UI automatically updates when the data (or its order) in the list changes.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `TruthTable`, which `Person` references. This allows `TruthTable` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Person` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="700" />

The `Storage` component,

- can save both TruthTable data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
- inherits from both `TruthTableStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
- depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** Currently, as `Team`, `Task` and the overall `TruthTable` objects all have references to 
`Person`, for ease of a copy of the entire `Person` object is stored within each of its `JsonAdaptedXYZ` parent objects 
in the json file (where `XYZ` refers to `Team`, `Task` or `TruthTable`. An alternative (arguably better) implementation 
would be to only store the name of each `Person` object and repopulate its fields from the `TruthTable` list of `Person`
objects, which would reduce repetition.
</div>


### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Team Feature

#### Implementation

The `add team` feature allows users to add a specific team to their list of teams.

The `TruthTable` object is designed to have a list of teams called `UniqueTeamList`.

The following is an example of how a team is added:

Precondition: Team name is valid (it cannot be empty or begin with a space)
1. User keys in the add team command with the name of the team to be added (e.g. `add team CS2103`)
2. A team is created added to the team list.

If the team name provided is invalid, an appropriate exception will be thrown and the respective error message will be
shown to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes the action taken when the `AddTeamCommand` is executed.
![AddTeamActivityDiagram](images/AddTeamActivityDiagram.png)

### Add Task Feature

#### Implementation

The `add task` feature allows users to add a specific task to their team's task list. The following is an example of how
a task is added:

Precondition: Task name is valid (it cannot be empty or have quotation marks).

1. User keys in the add task command with the name of the task to be added (e.g. `add task Complete Resume`)
2. A task is created and added to the current team's task list.

If the task name provided is invalid, an appropriate exception will be thrown and the respective error message will be
shown to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes the action taken when `AddTaskCommand` is executed:
![AddTaskActivityDiagram](images/AddTaskActivityDiagram.png)

_Activity diagram of adding a task_

#### Design considerations:

- **Alternative 1**: Store a global list of tasks and each task keeps track of which team it was created for through an
  attribute.
    - Pros: A single list of tasks makes it easier to list all the tasks associated with all teams.
    - Cons: Does not accurately model how teams actually work in terms of task distribution.
- **Alternative 2**: Each team stores a list of tasks that are associated with it.
    - Pros: Better modularization since a team contains all the information related to itself, including the tasks
      associated with it.
    - Cons: It is slightly more complicated to find the list of all tasks associated with a person if the person belongs
      to multiple teams since there multiple task lists.

We decided to use alternative 2 because it scales better as the number of teams increase.

### Mark Task as Done Feature

#### Implementation

The `mark` feature allows users to mark a specific task as done.

The following is an example usage scenario of how a task is marked as done:

Precondition: Task index provided is valid.

1. User keys in mark command with the specific index of the task. (e.g. `mark 1`)
2. The first task in the task list is marked as done.

If any of the following occurs:

1. Index given is negative
2. Index given is out of range (i.e. There are fewer tasks than the specified index)
3. Task has already been marked as done

Then, an appropriate exception will be thrown and the respective error message will be shown to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes the action taken when `MarkCommand` is executed:

![MarkActivityDiagram](images/MarkActivityDiagram.png)

_Activity diagram of marking task as done_

### Add Member to Team Feature

#### Implementation

The add member to team feature allows users to add a user to the current team using the person's name.

The following is an example usage scenario of how a member is added to a team:

Precondition: Index provided is valid and the current working team is set to the team that the member should be added to.

1. User keys in `add member` command along with the person's index.
2. The person at the specified index in the list is added to the team.

If any of the following occurs:

1. The index provided is less than 1
2. The index provided is greater than the number of persons in TruthTable
3. Person at the specified index is already in the team

Then, an appropriate exception will be thrown and the respective error message will be shown to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes the action taken when the `AddMemberCommand` is executed:

![AddMemberActivityDiagram](images/AddMemberActivityDiagram.png)

_Activity diagram of adding member to team_

In the `Logic` component, once `LogicManager#execute()` is called, `TruthTableParser` and `AddMemberCommandParser`
parses the index of the person in the user input, and generates a `AddMemberCommand` object. `LogicManager` then
executes the `AddMemberCommand` object, which adds the person to the current team in the `Model` component. A
`CommandResult` is generated with a message indicating the person being added to the team.

### List Members Feature

#### Implementation

The list members feature allows users to view the members in their current team.

The list members command updates the `PersonListPanel` and shows the members in the
current team.

Currently, `PersonListPanel` displays all persons that satisfy some `Predicate`, which is stored in the
`filteredPersons` in `ModelManager`.

Whenever list members command is called, the `Predicate` for `filteredPersons` is then updated and the corresponding
members of the team is shown.

The following sequence diagram illustrates what happens within the `Logic` component when the list members command is
executed:
![ListMembersSequenceDiagram](images/ListMembersSequenceDiagram.png)

### Randomly Assign Task Feature
#### Implementation

The randomly assign task feature allows users to assign a `Task` (within a particular `Team`) to a random team member (
represented as a `Person` object) within the team, who are not already assigned to that `Task`.

This functionality is exposed to the user through the `assign random` command, and the logic is executed
in `AssignTaskRandomlyCommand#execute()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and the state of the `Team` object at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application and adds multiple users into the current team, as well as at least one task.
The `Team` will contain multiple `Person` objects (representing team members).

![RandomlyAssignTaskState0](images/RandomlyAssignTaskState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes the command `assign random 1` to assign the first (and only) `Task` randomly to any team
member. As none of the team members have been added, all of them are candidates for random assignment. One of them will
be randomly assigned the task (see <span style="color:red">red arrow</span>).

![RandomlyAssignTaskState1](images/RandomlyAssignTaskState1.png)

Step 3. The user may want to assign a second team member to the task, hence executing `assign random 1` again. The
team member who has previously been allocated will not be considered. Similar to above, one more team member will be
randomly allocated the task (see <span style="color:red">red arrow</span>).

![RandomlyAssignTaskState2](images/RandomlyAssignTaskState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">
:information_source: **Note:** If there are no team members left to allocate (e.g. all team members have already been assigned to this task), an error will be thrown.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes the flow of `AssignTaskRandomlyCommand#execute()`.

![RandomlyAssignTaskActivityDiagram](images/RandomlyAssignTaskActivityDiagram.png)

_Activity diagram of randomly assigning a task_

### Add Link Feature

#### Implementation

The add link feature allows users to add links to their current team.

The add link command updates the `LinkListPanel` and adds the link to the list.

The following is an example usage scenario of how a member is added to a team:

Precondition: Link name and URL provided is valid and the current working team is set to the team that the link should
be added to.

1. User keys in `add link` command along with the `-n` flag and the link name, and the `-l` flag and the link URL.
2. The link is added to the link list of the current working team.

If any of the following occurs:

1. The link name is invalid
2. The URL is badly formatted
3. Either the link or the URL is missing

Then, an appropriate exception will be thrown and the respective error message will be shown to the user.

The following activity diagram summarizes the action taken when the `AddMemberCommand` is executed:

![AddLinkActivityDiagram](images/AddLinkActivityDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram illustrates what happens within the `Logic` component when the add link command is
executed:

## Effort

TruthTable was a complex project requiring extensive effort by all our team members.

### Going beyond our limits
Here are some features of our project that makes our project distinct and unique:

#### Using `picocli` as our parsing library
As our app is catered for Software Engineering team leads, we wanted our app to feel similar to other Command-Line 
Interfaces (CLI) they may be acquainted with.
Software Engineering team leads are generally proficient with using the Terminal to get things done, 
such as using `git` via its CLI, and many are highly familiar with the shell on Linux OS. Hence, we decided that the 
original  AddressBook Level-3 (AB3) parser was not suitable as its syntax was relatively unintuitive, and steepens the 
learning curve for our target users.


We opted to scrape the parsers and used [picocli](https://picocli.info/) as our parsing library, which enabled things 
like subcommands (using commands with spaces in them like `add person` instead of `add_person`) and flags to specify 
options (e.g. `-n` vs `n/` in AB3), which and makes it **more intuitive** for users.

#### Multiple Classes
As our application's primary function is to manage software engineering projects, including URLs, tasks, and team members 
within each team, we had to introduce new classes like `Team`, `Task` and `Link`. This added a high degree of complexity
to our app as entities can be tied to each other in multiple ways, such as enabling tasks to have multiple assignees.
This allows our app to provide extra functionality that makes our app more useful for Software Engineering team leads.

This resulted in the number of commands increasing from **9** (in AB3) to **42** (in TruthTable), which meant
that more classes had to be written to accommodate the wide variety of commands (including intermediary data types such 
as `Index` and new objects in our model such as `Team` and `Task`), and more testing had to be done to ensure our 
app works as intended.

#### Improved UI
The original AB3 program only displayed the list of persons which is not very useful for a task management application.
To make our app effective, we created additional panels for teams, members, tasks and links which makes it easier for the
user to track the status of their team as they execute their commands. 

In terms of colour scheme, we thought that the dark theme of AB3 was uninspiring and made use of own light theme to give
this app a nice, warm and welcoming feel. For users that prefer a dark scheme however, we have provided the ability to 
switch themes as well.

#### Extensive Testing
The use of picocli meant that all parser classes had to be removed, and the way the commands are generated is
different. Hence, all commands and parser tests in AB3 had to be removed and reimplemented.

Furthermore, the increased number of classes, along with all the commands, means that code coverage is likely to decrease 
and more testing had to be done.

Hence, we took it as an opportunity to do extensive testing for our application through writing effective unit tests 
for our commands, parsers and model objects. We redesigned how testing is done for commands and manage to cover
all commands successfully. We maintained a **~73%** code coverage from the original **~72%** in AB3, and increased the
number of test cases from **248** (in AB3) to **527** (in TruthTable).

### Conclusion
Overall, this project has been extremely fulfilling, and we believe our team has managed to create a highly functional app.
Over the few months of development, we pushed our limits and picked up skills that are extremely valuable in writing 
quality code and designing robust software.

This section only scratches the surface of the level of effort that we put into this project, and there were many
other things like the countless discussions that went into design decisions big and small, and the invisible effort of 
documentation in this project. The additional challenges that we overcome as a team are not included here for the sake 
of brevity.

Hopefully, we hope that this Developer Guide will help you to understand the design and implementation of TruthTable. We
welcome all Software Engineering student team leads to try, maintain or even extend our application.
