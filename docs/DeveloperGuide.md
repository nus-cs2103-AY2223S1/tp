## **About FindMyIntern**

FindMyIntern is a desktop application designed to help students keep track of their internship applications. 
It allows students to: 
1. Consolidate all these applications into a single place 
2. Manage these applications
3. Visualise their application statuses

The use of this Developer Guide is to document how FindMyIntern is designed and developed to **provide insights for 
developers** on the design considerations made for each feature.
In addition, it provides a macro and micro overview of the architecture of FindMyIntern to **guide new developers to navigate
through the code base**.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div class="btn-group btn-group-sm mt-2 mb-3">
<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="--bs-btn-font-size: .8rem;"><i class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up me-2"></i>Back to table of contents</a>
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternshipListPanel`, etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Internship` object residing in the `Model`.

<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="--bs-btn-font-size: .8rem;"><i class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up me-2"></i>Back to table of contents</a>
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FindMyInternParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an internship).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FindMyInternParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `FindMyInternParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div class="btn-group btn-group-sm mt-2 mb-3">
<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="--bs-btn-font-size: .8rem;"><i class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up me-2"></i>Back to table of contents</a>
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the findMyIntern data i.e., all `Internship` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueInternshipList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Internship` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Internship>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FindMyIntern`, which `Internship` references. This allows `FindMyIntern` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Internship` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

</div>

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T14-1/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both FindMyIntern data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `FindMyInternStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

* [Add feature](#add-internship-feature)
* [Find feature](#find-internships-from-keywords)
* [Filter feature](#filter-by-applicationstatus-feature)
* [Mark feature](#mark-internship-feature)
* [Sort feature](#sort-internships-feature)

### Add `Internship` feature

#### Implementation

- An `AddCommandParser` class is created, which parses the user input by splitting the input by its prefixes, then returns the relevant `AddCommand`.
- `AddCommand` takes in an `Internship`.
- `Internship` holds the details of the `Internship` that the user wants to add.

When `execute` of `AddCommand` is run, the `Internship` is passed into the model to be added to the Internship list.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add command:

<img src="images/AddCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="650" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

- **Adding of internships with same company name:**
  - **Alternative 1:** Do not allow internships with same company name
    - Pros: Only need to check for duplicate company names
    - Cons: Do not allow multiple internships with the same company, even if the applications are for different roles
  - **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Allow internships with same company name if they have different tags
    - Pros: Allow multiple internships with the same company
    - Cons: Need to check for both duplicate company names and duplicate tags

<div class="btn-group btn-group-sm mt-2 mb-3">
<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="--bs-btn-font-size: .8rem;"><i class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up me-2"></i>Back to table of contents</a>
</div>

### Find `Internships` from keywords

#### Implementation

- `FindCommandParser` parses the user input by splitting the input by whitespaces.
- The parsed user input, also known as keywords, are then passed to the predicate `ContainsKeywordsPredicate`.
- `FindCommand` then takes in the `ContainsKeywordsPredicate` containing the keywords.
- When `FindCommand#execute(model)` is called, it updates the given model to the `Internship` list where the `Company` or `Tag` matches the keywords.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the Logic component as explained above.

<img src="images/FindSequenceDiagram.png" width="850" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

- Allowing for multiple keywords to show more than 1 specific internship in list
- **Components of `Internship` to be matched**
    - **Alternative 1:** Match all components of `Internship`, e.g. `Description`, `Link`, `Company`, etc.
        - Pros: Better search capability
        - Cons: Less specific internship list
    - **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Only allow for matching of `Company` and `Tag`
        - Pros: More logical search (A typical search would consist of roles or company name)
        - Cons: May not be what users want to search
- **Matching of keywords:**
  - **Alternative 1:** Only allows full word match
      - Pros: More specific internship list
      - Cons: Require typing full name of company or tag
  - **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Allows partial word match
      - Pros: Allow quick searching for company or tag
      - Cons: Less specific internship list

</div>

### Filter by `ApplicationStatus` feature

#### What it does

The filter by `ApplicationStatus` feature allows users to filter internship applications according to specific application statuses.
The command format is `filter APPLICATION_STATUS`, where `filter` is the command and `APPLICATION_STATUS` is either `applied`, `shortlisted`, `interviewed`, `accepted`, or `rejected`.

#### Implementation

There are some similarities between how the filter feature and the find feature were implemented.

* The filter feature makes use of `FilterCommand`, `FilterCommandParser`, `ApplicationStatus`, and `InternshipHasApplicationStatusPredicate`.
  * `InternshipHasApplicationStatusPredicate` implements `Predicate<Internship>`, and holds the `ApplicationStatus` that the user is filtering for.
* It also calls `Model#updateFilteredInternshipList(Predicate<Internship>)` which filters the `Internship` list with the user-specified `ApplicationStatus`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Command execution

1. User enters filter command with valid application status.
2. `FindMyInternParser` parses the input and creates a `FilterCommandParser` object.
3. `FilterCommandParser` parses the input by passing it to `ApplicationStatus`.
4. A new `InternshipHasApplicationStatusPredicate` object is created from the returned `ApplicationStatus`.
5. `FilterCommandParser` creates a new `FilterCommand` object which accepts the `InternshipHasApplicationStatusPredicate` object.
6. When `FilterCommand#execute(model)` is run, it updates the model with the `InternshipHasApplicationStatusPredicate` and filters the `Internship` list with the user-specified application status.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a filter command:

<img src="images/FilterCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="480" />

The sequence diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component as explained above.

<img src="images/FilterSequenceDiagram.png" width="1000" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Design Considerations

* The implementation is similar to `FindCommand` as both have the same idea of filtering/finding something in the list.
* The model already supports filtering for a certain predicate, therefore it is only intuitive that `FilterCommand` would make use of this functionality, just like how `FindCommand` would.
* This implementation would allow easy extension should there be more `ApplicationStatus` added, since parsing of user input is done by `ApplicationStatus`.
* The `filter` command does not require `PREFIX_APPPLICATION_STATUS` (`s/`).
  * This is in contrast to `mark` command which requires and takes in both `Index` and `ApplicationStatus`, and therefore requires the `PREFIX_APPLICATION_STATUS` to correctly parse input.
  * While having `PREFIX_APPPLICATION_STATUS` would be more consistent, it is redundant and unintuitive since the command only takes in one input, `ApplicationStatus`.

<div class="btn-group btn-group-sm mt-2 mb-3">
<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="--bs-btn-font-size: .8rem;"><i class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up me-2"></i>Back to table of contents</a>
</div>


### Edit `Internship` feature

#### Implementation

* An `EditCommandParser` object is created, which parses the user input by splitting the input by the prefix of each field in `Internship`, then returns the relevant `EditCommand`.
* `EditCommand` takes in an `index` and at least one of `Internship`'s fields.

When `execute` of `EditCommand` is run, a new `Internship` object with the updated fields is created.
* The new `Internship` is passed into the model to be updated.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an edit command.

<img src="images/EditCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="650" />

#### Design Considerations
- The fields passed in are optional, but at least one must be provided. 


### Mark `Internship` feature

#### Implementation

`MarkCommand` was implemented similar to how `EditCommand` was implemented.
* A `MarkCommandParser` object is created, which parses the user input by splitting the input by `PREFIX_APPLICATION_STATUS`, then returns the relevant `MarkCommand`.
* `MarkCommand` takes in an `index` and `applicationStatus`.
* When `execute` of `MarkCommand` is run, a new `Internship` object with the updated `applicationStatus` is created, with all other fields unchanged. 
* The new `Internship` is passed into the model to be updated.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a mark command.

<img src="images/MarkCommandActivityDiagram.png" width="650" />


#### Design Considerations
- The new `applicationStatus` must be different from the existing one for it to be updated.
- **Types of `applicationStatus`:**
  - **Alternative 1:** Allow any user input as `applicationStatus`
    * Pros: Variation of `applicationStatus` is not limited
    * Cons: Impossible to implement filter by `ApplicationStatus`
    feature
  - **Alternative 2 (current choice)**: Have a fixed set of `applicationStatus` that can be passed in
    - Pros: Allow easy filtering by `ApplicationStatus`
    - Cons: Fixed variation of `applicationStatus`

<div class="btn-group btn-group-sm mt-2 mb-3">
<a href="#table-of-contents" class="btn btn-outline-light link-primary" style="--bs-btn-font-size: .8rem;"><i class="bi bi-chevron-bar-up me-2"></i>Back to table of contents</a>
</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Sort `Internships` feature
	
#### Implementation

- `ModelManager` provides a `FilteredList` that is stored as an `ObservableList`. `InternshipListPanel` stores this `ObservableList` to display the list of internship applications to the user.
- In order to sort the list of applications, we wrap the `FilteredList` as a `SortedList` in `ModelManager` 
before returning it as the `ObservableList`.
- This allows ModelManager to accept a `Comparator` using the method `updateSortedInternshipList` 
and update the `Comparator` of the `SortedList`.
- The `SortedList` will then be sorted according to the `Comparator` provided and the `ObservableList` will display the 
internship applications in the sorted order.

The following sequence diagram illustrates how the list is updated when the user enters the `sort applied` command:

<img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png" width="450" />


#### Design Considerations

- Display internships from the latest date to the earliest date to easily refer to recent applications	
- **Storing the list of internship applications**:
    - **Alternative 1:** Update the stored internship list according to the sort criteria
        - Pros: Easily view in sorted order without having to re-type sort command
        - Cons: Not able to view original order once sorted
    - **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Maintain the stored list according to the order it was added by user
        - Pros: Allow user to view internship applications in the original order it was added 
        - Cons: Have to re-enter the sort command when the reopens the application

### Non-Functional Requirements

1. Should work on any _mainstream OS_ as long as it has Java `11` or above installed.
2. Should be able to hold up to 1000 internship applications without a noticeable sluggishness in performance for typical usage.
3. A user with above average typing speed for regular English text (i.e. not code, not system admin commands) should be able to accomplish most of the tasks faster using commands than using the mouse.
4. Should be more efficient than a typical spreadsheet application. 
5. Should be easy to pick up for people who are not proficient with technology.
6. Should be able to work without any internet connection.

### Glossary

* **Mainstream OS**: Windows, Linux, Unix, OS-X
* **ApplicationStatus**: Internship application status which is either `applied`, `shortlisted`, `interviewed`, `accepted`, or `rejected`
* **GUI (Graphical User Interface)**: A system of interactive visual components for computer software for users to interact with.
* **CLI (Command Line Interface)**: A text-based interface that communicate with users in the form of lines of text.

## **Appendix: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

   1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

   2. Double-click the jar file<br>
      Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample internship applications. The window size may not be optimal.

2. Saving window preferences

   1. Resize the window to an optimal size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

   2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
      Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.


### Deleting an internship

1. Deleting an internship while all internships are being shown

   1. Prerequisites: List all internships using the `list` command. Multiple internships in the list.

   1. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
      Expected: First internship application is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted internship application shown in the status message.

   1. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
      Expected: No internship application is deleted. Error details shown in the status message.

   1. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
      Expected: Similar to previous.
   
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Saving data

1. Dealing with missing data files
   1. To simulate a missing data file, delete `findmyintern.json` from the `data` directory.
   2. Run `findmyintern.jar`. <br>
      Expected: The GUI gives the user the default sample data of internship applications. A new `findmyintern.json` file
      containing the sample data is created.

2. Dealing with corrupted data files
   1. To simulate a corrupted data file, open `findmyintern.json` in a text editor software and delete the first `{`.
   2. Run `findmyintern.jar`. <br>
      Expected: The GUI will show an empty list of internship applications. A new empty `findmyintern.json` file is created.
