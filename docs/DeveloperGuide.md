PleaseHireUs (PHU) is an internship tracking application specially customised for CS students who are struggling to 
keep track of their applications. PHU has been optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still 
having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Fast typists would be able to work more efficiently.

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/phu/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/phu/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.


<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/phu/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `InternshipListPanel`, `ReminderBarFooter`, `ViewCommandPanel`, `StackedBarPanel` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/phu/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml).

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Internship` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/phu/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `InternshipBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an internship).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` and `DeleteCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `InternshipBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `InternshipBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, …​) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/phu/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="850" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the internship book data i.e., all `Internship` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueInternshipList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Internship` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Internship>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components).

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `InternshipBook`, which `Internship` references. This allows `InternshipBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Internship` needing their own `Tag` objects.<br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W17-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/phu/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both internship book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `InternshipBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`).

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.phu.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for some components should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

### Add feature

#### Proposed Implementation
The implementation of the add command involves creating a new `Internship` objects and storing them in the 
InternshipBook.json using the `JsonAdaptedInternship` class.

The add command has the following fields:
- `n/` prefix followed by the name of the company
- `p/` prefix followed by the name of the position
- `pr/` prefix followed by the application status (Optional)
- `d/` prefix followed by important dates to be taken note of (Optional)
- `ph/` prefix followed by the phone number of the HR (Optional)
- `e/` prefix followed by the email of the HR (Optional)
- `web/` prefix followed by the website link for more internship details (Optional)
- `r/` prefix followed by any additional remarks (Optional)
- `t/` prefix followed by relevant tags (Optional)

The system will validate the parameters supplied by the user. When input validation fails, error message specifying the
first identified error will be shown to the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add command works.

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
**Whether an internship application can be added without all attributes**:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Allow for optional parameters with default values
    * Pros: Enhances users' convenience
    * Cons: Modifications of `equals` method for optional parameters required
  
* **Alternative 2** All parameters must be filled up
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: Lengthy command

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Delete feature

#### Proposed Implementation
PHU allows users to delete multiple internships in one command. The proposed delete mechanism involves keeping track of the positions of `Internship` to be deleted, which is implemented by using `Indexes` class, and deleting all the corresponding internships.

The following sequence diagram shows how the delete command works.

![DeleteSequenceDiagram2](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram2.png)

#### Design considerations
**How to keep track of the positions of `Internship` to be deleted**:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use a new class called `Indexes`
  * Pros: Improve maintainability
  * Cons: Harder to implement

* **Alternative 2** Use `java.util.Set`
  * Pros: Easier to implement
  * Cons: Harder to maintain in the future

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Edit feature

#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed edit mechanism involves creating a new `Internship` object and replacing the previous `Internship` object to be edited. It's mainly implemented using the help of `EditInternshipDescriptor` class, which can create a new Internship given the edited fields.

Similar to add command, the edit command has the following fields:
- `INDEX` which represents the position of the internship to be edited
- `n/` prefix followed by the edited name of the company (Optional)
- `p/` prefix followed by the edited name of the position (Optional)
- `pr/` prefix followed by the edited application status (Optional)
- `d/` prefix followed by the edited important dates to be taken note of (Optional)
- `ph/` prefix followed by the edited phone number of the HR (Optional)
- `e/` prefix followed by the edited email of the HR (Optional)
- `web/` prefix followed by the edited website link for more internship details (Optional)
- `r/` prefix followed by the edited additional remarks (Optional)
- `t/` prefix followed by edited tags (Optional)

Although the nine prefixes shown above are all optional, the system still require user to edit at least one prefix. Similar to the add command, the system will also validate the parameters supplied by the user.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit command works

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
**Whether editing an internship will create a new internship**:
* **Alternative 1(Current choice)**: Edit command will create a new internship
    * Pros: Help maintains the immutability of `Internship` class
    * Cons: Not the most efficient way
* **Alternative 2**: Edit command will not create a new internship. It will directly edit the selected internship
    * Pros: More efficient, both time and space wise, than the previous alternative
    * Cons: `Internship` class won't be immutable, which reduces the defensiveness of the program

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### List feature

#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed list mechanism is implemented mainly using the help of `ListCommandParser` and `ComparableCategoryParser` 
classes. The `ListCommand` class extends the `Command` class and implements `ListCommand#execute`. The `list` command 
can be used to show all existing internships stored in the system and have the option to sort the internships by the 
specified category.

The following sequence diagram shows how the find command works.

![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Design Considerations
**Parameters for list command**:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `CATEGORY` and `DESCENDING` parameter is optional 
    * Pros: Improved flexibility
    * Cons: Need to have conditional checks in Parser class

* **Alternative 2** Users have to input all parameters
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: Command is longer and more cumbersome to type
    
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Find feature

#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed find mechanism is implemented mainly using the help of `ContainsKeywordPredicate`
It implements `Predicate<Internship>` where the test method checks if the data in a certain category
of the Internship matches any of the specified keywords.

The predicate is used in the Model interface on the `updateFilteredInternshipList` method

The following sequence diagram shows how the find command works.

![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
**How to filter the Internships**:
* Use a class for the predicate and `javafx.collections.transformation.FilteredList` (current)
  * Pros: Simple, Better cohesion, more maintainability
  * Cons: More code to write

**How to keep track of the list of `Keyword`**:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Use a new class called `KeywordList`
  * Pros: Improved flexibility and maintability
  * Cons: More methods to implement

* **Alternative 2** Use `java.util.Set`:
  * Pros: Easier to implement
  * Cons: Lower maintainability

**Parameters for find command**:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `CATEGORY` parameter is optional
    * Pros: Improved quality of life for the user
    * Cons: Need to have conditional checks in Parser class

* **Alternative 2** Users have to input all parameters
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: Command is longer and more cumbersome to type

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedInternshipBook`. It extends `InternshipBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `internshipBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedInternshipBook#commitChange()` — Saves the current internship book state in its history.
* `VersionedInternshipBook#undo()` — Restores the previous internship book state from its history, if exists.
* `VersionedInternshipBook#redo()` — Restores a previously undone internship book state from its history, if exists.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, `Model#undoInternshipBook()` and `Model#redoInternshipBook()` respectively.

Besides `VersionedInternshipBook`, undo/redo mechanism is also helped by `CommandHistory`. It exists inside `LogicManager` and implements the following operation,

* `CommandHistory#getPreviousModifyCommand()` — Get the command to be undone, if exists.
* `CommandHistory#getNextModifyCommand()`Get the command to be redone, if exists.

In essence, `CommandHistory` will enable the undo and redo command to show which command was undone/redone, which gives a better user experience.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedInternshipBook` will be initialized with the initial internship book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single internship book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 1` command to delete the 1st internship in the internship book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, causing the modified state of the internship book after the `delete 1` command executes to be saved in the `internshipBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted internship book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add n/Optiver p/Quant` to add a new internship. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, causing another modified internship book state to be saved into the `internshipBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, so the internship book state will not be saved into the `internshipBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the internship was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoInternshipBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous internship book state, and restores the internship book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial InternshipBook state, then there are no previous InternshipBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoInternshipBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoInternshipBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the internship book to that state.

The following sequence diagram shows how the redo command works:

![RedoSequenceDiagram](images/RedoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `internshipBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest internship book state, then there are no undone InternshipBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoInternshipBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the internship book, such as `list`, will usually not call `Model#commitInternshipBook()`, `Model#undoInternshipBook()` or `Model#redoInternshipBook()`. Thus, the `internshipBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitInternshipBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `internshipBookStateList`, all internship book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/Optiver p/Quant` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire internship book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the internship being deleted).
  * Cons: Quite hard to implement as we must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### View feature

#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed view mechanism is implemented mainly using the help of `ExactMatchPredicate`.
It implements `Predicate<Internship>` where the test method looks for the exact match of the internship requested.

The predicate is used in the Model interface on the `updateViewItem` method

The following sequence diagram shows how the view command works.

![ViewSequenceDiagram](images/ViewSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
**How to view the Internship**:
* Use a class for the predicate and `javafx.collections.transformation.FilteredList` (current)
    * Pros: Simple, Better cohesion, more maintainability
    * Cons: More code to write

**How to display the internship in view panel**:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Fully display with prefix denoting category
    * Pros: More descriptive and easier to understand
    * Cons: Makes UI seem wordy

* **Alternative 2** Only display details with no category
    * Pros: Looks cleaner
    * Cons: Difficult to understand for new users

**Parameters for view command**:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: `INDEX` parameter only takes in one index
    * Pros: Easier to implement
    * Cons: User will have to use the `view` command multiple times to view multiple internships

* **Alternative 2** `INDEX` parameter can have multiple indexes
    * Pros: User can view multiple details at once
    * Cons: Makes `view` UI panel large, difficult to implement

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Copy feature

#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed copy mechanism is implemented mainly using the help of `CopyCommandParser`
It implements `Predicate<Internship>` where the test method looks for the exact match of the internship requested.

The following sequence diagram shows how the copy command works.

![CopySequenceDiagram](images/CopySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
**How to copy the Internship**:
* Use `java.awt` library `Toolkit` and `StringSelection` classes (current)
    * Pros: Simple, cleaner code
    * Cons: Limited extensibility

**How to copy the internship details**:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Copy to clipboard
    * Pros: Easy to use
    * Cons: Unable to choose the exact selection to copy

* **Alternative 2** Make text highlightable to manually copy
    * Pros: Can choose the exact selection to copy
    * Cons: Slow to use

**Parameters for copy command**:
* `INDEX` parameter only takes in one index
    * Pros: Easier to implement, makes more sense
  
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
    
### Bar Chart

#### Implementation
The Bar Chart is implemented to using a mix of the MVC Pattern.
It is mainly facilitated by the `StackedBarPanel` class which acts as the controller
on the MCV design pattern and the `Statistic` class which provides the calculation
logic on the width of each section of the Bar Chart.

The following sequence diagram shows how the Bar Chart works when a change is triggered.

![Barchart Sequence Diagram](images/BarChartSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations
**Data to be processed**:
* **Alternative 1 (current choice)**: Only process the displayed data
  * Pros: More flexible, easier to implement
  * Cons: Might confuse users initially

* **Alternative 2**: Process all the data including the one not currently displayed
  * Pros: More intuitive for users
  * Cons: Less flexible, harder to implement 

**How to update the data**:
* Use the Observer Design Pattern
  * Pros: Inbuilt support for the Observer pattern, prevent coupling
