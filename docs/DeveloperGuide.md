### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jeryl/fyp/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jeryl/fyp/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete -s i/A0123456X`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jeryl/fyp/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `CompletedStudentListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jeryl/fyp/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student` object residing in the `Model`.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jeryl/fyp/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `FypManagerParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete -s i/A0123456X")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete -s i/A0123456X` Command](images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `FypManagerParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStudentCommand`) which the `FypManagerParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStudentCommandParser`, `DeleteStudentCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jeryl/fyp/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the FYP manager data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `FypManager`, which `Student` references. This allows `FypManager` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each `Student` needing their own `Tag` objects.

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F09-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/jeryl/fyp/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both FYP manager data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `FypManagerStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `jeryl.fyp.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Adding a student to the FYP manager
This feature allows professors as users to keep track of students that are supervised under, as well as the project each student is working on.

#### Implementation details
The add student feature is facilitated by `AddStudentCommandParser` and `AddStudentCommand`. The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addStudent()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add student mechanism behaves at each step:
1. The user enters the add student command and provides the name of the student, the student ID, the project name, and the student's email.
2. `FypManagerParser` creates a new `AddStudentCommandParser` after preliminary processing of user input.
3. `AddStudentCommandParser` then processes the input again and creates an `AddStudentCommand`.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `AddStudentCommand` using the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
5. `AddStudentCommand` checks if the student has existed before using `Model#hasStudent()`.
6. If the student is not inside the student list yet, `AddStudentCommand` calls `Model#addStudent()` and passes the student as the parameter.
7. Finally, `AddStudentCommand` creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager` to complete the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add student command works:

<img src="images/AddStudentSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddStudentCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

#### Design considerations
An add student command is designed to add a single student along with its detail particulars such as one's student ID, student name, project name, and email. These details are the important details every professor needs from a student so that the professor can understand the work of the student and is able to contact the student when needed.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Adding a deadline to a student in the FYP manager
This feature allows professors as users to keep track of students deadlines that are supervised under.

#### Implementation details
The add student feature is facilitated by `AddDeadlineCommandParser` and `AddDeadlineCommand`. The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addDeadline()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add deadline mechanism behaves at each step:
1. The user enters the add deadline command and provides the name of the deadline, the student ID, and deadline date(optional parameter).
2. `FypManagerParser` creates a new `AddDeadlineCommandParser` after preliminary processing of user input.
3. `AddDeadlineCommandParser` then processes the input again and creates an `AddDeadlineCommand`.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `AddDeadlineCommand` using the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
5. `AddDeadlineCommand` gets student using StudentID via `Model#getStudentByStudentId(studentId)`.
6. `AddDeadlineCommand` checks if the deadline has existed before using `Model#hasDeadline()`.
7. `AddDeadlineCommand` checks if the project is done using `Student#getProjectStatus().equals(new ProjectStatus("DONE"))`.
8. If the deadline is not inside the student deadline list yet, `AddDeadlineCommand` calls `Model#addDeadline()` and passes the student and deadline as the parameter.
9. Finally, `AddDeadlineCommand` creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager` to complete the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add deadline command works:

<img src="images/AddDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddDeadlineCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.


</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an add deadline command.

<img src="images/AddDeadlineActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Design considerations

An add deadline command is designed to add a single deadline along with its deadline date to a particular student. This helps the professor to keep track of which deadline is assigned to which student easily.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Deleting a student from the FYP manager
This feature allows professors to delete students who have dropped their FYP

#### Implementation details

The delete student feature is facilitated by `DeleteStudentCommandParser` and `DeleteStudentCommand`. The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#DeleteStudent()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete student mechanism behaves at each step:
1. The user enters delete student command and provides the student ID of student to be deleted.
2. `FypManagerParser` creates a new `DeleteStudentCommandParser` after preliminary processing of user input.
3. `DeleteStudentCommandParser` creates a new `DeleteStudentCommand` based on the processed input.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `DeleteStudentCommand`.
5. `DeleteStudentCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredStudentList()` to get the list of student with FYP, and then gets the student at the specified index using the unique studentId.
6. `DeleteStudentCommand` calls `Model#DeleteStudent()` and passes the studentID, and return student deleted as parameters.
7. Finally, `DeleteStudentCommand` creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager` to complete the command.


The following sequence diagram shows how delete student command works:

<img src="images/DeleteStudentSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStudentCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete student command.

<img src="images/DeleteStudentActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Design considerations

The delete student command is designed to be used in conjunction with find student command. For instance, the user would first use find student using project name to find the student taking FYP using `find machine`
to find students taking machine learning projects before doing `delete -s i/A0123456X` to remove student from FYP Manager.

This integration between delete student command with find student command is important because FypManager can store large number of students with FYP, making it not feasible for users to scroll through the list.
By utilizing find student, users can find the student with only partial information and retrieve the student ID Using this student ID, users can delete the student from the FypManager once he/she drops the FYP.

### Deleting a deadline from a student in the FYP manager

#### Implementation details

The delete deadline feature is facilitated by `DeleteDeadlineCommandParser` and `DeleteDeadlineCommand`. The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#DeleteDeadline()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the delete deadline mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user enters delete deadline command and provides the student ID and rank of deadline to be deleted.
2. `FypManagerParser` creates a new `DeleteDeadlineCommandParser` after preliminary processing of user input.
3. `DeleteDeadlineCommandParser` creates a new `DeleteDeadlineCommand` based on the processed input.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `DeleteDeadlineCommand`.
5. `DeleteCommand` calls `Model#getIndexByStudentId(index)` and passes the studentId, and gets the desired student.
6. `DeleteCommand` calls `Student#getDeadlineList().getDeadlineByRank(rank - 1)` and passes the rank, and gets the deadline.
7. `DeleteDeadlineCommand` calls `Model#deleteDeadline()` and passes the student, and deadline to be deleted.
8. Finally, `DeleteDeadlineCommand` creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager` to complete the command.


The following sequence diagram shows how delete deadline command works:

<img src="images/DeleteDeadlineSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteDeadlineCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a delete deadline command.

<img src="images/DeleteDeadlineActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Design considerations

The delete deadline command is designed to be used in conjunction with find student command. For instance, the user would first use find student using project name to find the student taking FYP using `find machine`
to find students taking machine learning projects before doing `delete -d i/A0123456X r/1` to remove student from FYP Manager.

This integration between delete deadline command with find student command is important because FypManager can store large number of students with FYP, making it not fesiable for users to scroll through the list.
By utilizing find student, users can find the student with only partial information and retrieve the student ID Using this student ID, users can delete the deadline from the FypManager once he/she drops the deadline task.

### Marking a project status
#### Implementation details
The MarkCommand feature marks the Project Status of an FYP project as one of 3 possible statuses
{***YTS***, ***IP***, ***DONE***}. Currently these are the only 3 statuses supported, although more may be implemented
later on if there are other meaningful statuses.

The MarkCommand feature sets a default status of `YTS` whenever a new FYP project is added to the FYP Manager, and the
MarkCommand allows us to accordingly the project Status to either `IP` if the student is still
working on the FYP project, or `DONE` once the FYP project has been completed.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how MarkCommand is utilised:

Step 1: The Professor launches the application for the first time. `FypManager` will be initialised with the
current FypManager state.

Step 2: The Professor tries adding a student to the FypManager by executing the command
`add i/A0123456G ...`. Note that here we have set the default project Status to be `YTS` since
the project has just been added.

![MarkCommandState1](images/MarkCommandState1.png)

Step 3: Suppose that the student Jane Doe has now started on the project. The Professor wishes to update the
project status for Jane to be `IP` instead of `YTS`, hence the Professor will execute the command
`mark i/A0123456G s/IP` to update the status accordingly.

![MarkCommandState2](images/MarkCommandState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the student ID is incorrect or the
status is not one of the statuses {`YTS`, `IP`, `DONE`}, then the command will not be executed and an appropriate
error message will be shown.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the MarkCommand operation works:

![MarkCommandSequenceDiagram](images/MarkCommandSequenceDiagram.jpg)

The following activity diagram illustrates what happens when a user executes `MarkCommand`:

![MarkCommandActivityDiagram](images/MarkCommandActivityDiagram.jpg)

#### Design considerations

**Implementation Choice: Why MarkCommand is implemented this way**
* We have only chosen to consider 3 general statuses {`YTS`, `IP`, `DONE`} since these are very general
labels that the Professor can use to identify the current status of an FYP project. This makes it very user-friendly
  since there are a fixed number of statuses that can be used.

* We have also used the studentId to uniquely identify the project of the student the Professor
is trying to find. Here we have made an assumption that there the StudentId uniquely identifies the FYP project
  (i.e. a student can only take exactly 1 FYP project under a certain Professor)
  This makes the Mark Command relatively easy to use in practice.

**Other Alternatives:**

* **Alternative 1:** Extend the Edit command to include the MarkCommand
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: No clear distinction between tags and project status

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

#### Implementation details

The edit student feature is facilitated by `EditCommandParser` and `EditCommand`. The operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#Edit()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit student mechanism behaves at each step:

1. The user enters delete deadline command and provides the student ID and other parameters(eg: student name, project name) to be changed to.
2. `FypManagerParser` creates a new `EditCommandParser` after preliminary processing of user input.
3. `EditCommandParser` creates a new `EditCommand` based on the processed input.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `EditCommand`.
5. `EditCommand` calls `Model#getFilteredStudentList()` and gets the student list.
6. `EditCommand` calls `Model#getIndexByStudentId(i)` and passes the studentId, and gets the desired student.
7. `EditCommand` calls `EditCommand#createEditedStudent(student, parameters)` and passes the student and parameters to be edited to.
8. `EditCommand` calls `EditCommand#setStudent(studentToEdit, editedStudent)` and passes the student and previous student object to be replaced.
9. `EditCommand` calls `EditCommand#updateFilteredStudentList(PREDICATE_SHOW_ALL_STUDENTS)` and updates the studentList.
10. Finally, `EditCommand` creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager` to complete the command.


The following sequence diagram shows how edit student command works:

<img src="images/EditSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `EditCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
Also, due to PlantUML limitations, we are not able to clearly show self-invocation methods well. Do take note that arrow supposed to start at beginning of activation bar and end at end of activation bar.

</div>

### Editing particulars of a student
The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes an edit command.

<img src="images/EditActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />

#### Design considerations

The edit command is designed to be used in conjunction with find student command. For instance, the user would first use find student using project name to find the student taking FYP using `find machine`
to find students taking machine learning projects before doing `edit A0123456X p/AI` to edit the student in FypManager.

This integration between edit command with find student command is important because FypManager can store large number of students with FYP, making it not feasible for users to scroll through the list.
By utilizing find student, users can find the student with only partial information and retrieve the student ID Using this student ID, users can edit the student attributes from the FypManager.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Showing help
#### Implementation
The help feature provides the professor or students with useful information on how to optimally make use of this Jeryl app.
The help feature mechanism is facilitated by `HelpCommand` and `HelpCommandParser`. `HelpCommand` extends from the abstract class `Command`
while `HelpCommandParser` extends from the interface `Parser`.
To summarize, it implements the following operation:
* `HelpCommand#execute()` — oversees the execution process for `HelpCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `HelpCommand`:
1. The user enters the `help` command or also provides the specific command of interest.
2. `FypManagerParser` creates a new `HelpCommandParser` after preliminary check of user input.
3. `HelpCommandParser` creates a new `HelpCommand` based on the processed input (different type of command keyword).
4. `LogicManager` executes the `HelpCommand` using the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
5. `HelpCommand` shows help message, and then creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager` to complete the command.
6. If it is just `HelpCommand`, `HelpWindow` would pop up with a link to JERYL user guide on it.

The following sequence diagram shows how the help command works:

<img src="images/HelpSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `HelpCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes am help command.

<img src="images/HelpActivityDiagram.png" width="550" />


<img src="images/helpMessage.png" width="550" />


### Listing the students and their FYPs
#### Implementation details
The list feature allows the professor to list all FYP students in the FYP Manager.
The list feature mechanism is facilitated by `ListCommand`. It extends from the abstract class `Command`.
To summarize, it implements the following operation:
* `ListCommand#execute()` — oversees the execution process for `ListCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `ListCommand`:
1. The user enters the list command
2. `FypManagerParser` creates a new `ListCommand` after preliminary check of user input.
3. `LogicManager` executes the `ListCommand` using the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
4. `ListCommand` updates a `ObservableList<Student>`, and then creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager` to complete the command.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list command works:

<img src="images/ListCommandSequenceDiagram.png" width="550" />

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a list command:

<img src="images/ListCommandActivityDiagram.png" />

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### Finding students based on criterias
#### Implementation details

The `FindCommand` feature allows the user to find for specific keywords in certain fields. The current
implementation supports finding keywords in four fields:
1) `StudentId`
2) `StudentName`
3)  `Tags` (accorded to a student)
4) `ProjectName`.

This is a new enhancement in v1.3, as older iterations only supported finding projects by their titles,
while the newest iteration supports finding projects by any of the above four fields. We hope that this allows the user
to be able to filter the projects more efficiently. (for instance, by project names:
***NeuralNetwork***, ***Blockchain***, etc.)

The FindCommand feature takes in a specified field (one of the four aforementioned fields), and a keyword specified
by the user. FypManager then returns a list of projects whose field contains the keyword inputted.

Note that the keyword is case-insensitive, can contain arbitrary spacing, and is field-specific.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how FindCommand is utilised:

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The 'FypManager' will be initialised with its
'FypManager' state.

Step 2: The user finds a project by keying in `find -p tree` to find all projects whose name contains the keyword
`tree`. FypManager returns a list of projects whose names contain the `tree` keyword.

![FindCommandState1](images/FindCommandState1.png)

Step 3: Suppose that the user wants to find another project with keyword `blockchain`. The user keys in
`find -p blockchain` to find all projects whose names contain the keyword `blockchain`. FypManager returns an empty
list, as there is no project whose project name contains `blockchain`.

![FindCommandState2](images/FindCommandState2.png)

Step 4: The user is unsure of the correct names of the projects that he wants to find, and decides to find for
multiple keywords `network / design`. The user keys in `find -p network / design` to find all projects whose names
contain either the keywords `network` or `design`. FypManager returns a list of projects whose names contain at least
one of the two keywords.

![FindCommandState3](images/FindCommandState3.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the FindCommand operation works:

![FindCommandSequenceDiagram](images/FindCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a list command:

![FindCommandActivityDiagram](images/FindCommandActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Implementation Choice: Why FindCommand is implemented this way**
* We have implemented FindCommand to find a student's project by four different fields. This is practical, since
  different users would want to find the relevant projects by different fields, making this a more versatile tool to use
  as a FypManager tool.

* We have allowed the user to be able to search using different keywords (so long as they are separated by ***/*** ),
  which lets the user be more flexible in his/her search criteria.

* Furthermore, we have made the input more flexible by making it case-insensitive, helping users who are not particularly
  careful with their input of capital-cases or lower-cases. This also mimics real-life query engines, which usually
  allow users to type their search keywords without fretting about whether there are upper-cases in the keyword.


**Other Alternatives:**

* **Alternative 1:** Extend the FindCommand by allowing the user to search by fields other than project name
    * Pros: Allows the users to search using more fields instead of ProjectName alone.
    * Cons: Harder to implement. And requires inclusion of a suffix.

***[v1.3 update: the above has been achieved as of this update. :) ]***

* **Alternative 2:** Allow the user to search for their keywords across all fields without specifying a field
    * Pros: More comprehensive search for projects with the required keyword.
    * Cons: Much harder to implement, as it requires a field-less search.

### Sorting the FYP manager based on a criteria
#### Proposed Implementation

This feature allows professors to sort the FYP projects by their project name, or by
the project status in the order {YTS, IP, DONE}.

#### Implementation details
The `Sort` feature is facilitated by 2 main Commands: `SortProjectNameCommand` and `SortProjectStatusCommand`.
Both of these commands extend from the abstract `Command`class. Note that we have fixed the sorting order
of `SortProjectStatusCommand` to be sorted in the order {YTS,IP,DONE} since projects that have YTS are more urgent,
hence we have placed them at the front of our FYP manager, followed by those that are IP, and finally
those that are DONE which are of the least urgency.

We give an example usage scenario of `SortProjectNameCommand` and `SortProjectStatusCommand`
* `SortProjectNameCommand`
    1. The user enters `sort -p` if he wishes to execute the `SortProjectNameCommand`
    2. FypManagerParser creates a new `SortProjectNameCommand` after preliminary check of user input.
    3. `LogicManager` executes the `SortProjectNameCommand` using the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
    4. `SortProjectNameCommand` creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager`, which will be
       identified as a `SortProjectNameCommand` so that our `MainWindow` will show the sorted List.

* `SortProjectStatusCommand`
    1. The user enters `sort -s` if he wishes to execute the `SortProjectStatusCommand`
    2. FypManagerParser creates a new `SortProjectNameCommand` after preliminary check of user input.
    3. `LogicManager` executes the `SortProjectStatusCommand` using the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
    4. `SortProjectStatusCommand` creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `LogicManager`, which will be
        identified as a `SortProjectStatusCommand` so that our `MainWindow` will show the sorted List.

### \[Proposed\] Undo/redo feature

#### Proposed Implementation

The proposed undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedFypManager`. It extends `FypManager` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `fypManagerStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedFypManager#commit()` — Saves the current FYP manager state in its history.
* `VersionedFypManager#undo()` — Restores the previous FYP manager state from its history.
* `VersionedFypManager#redo()` — Restores a previously undone FYP manager state from its history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitFypManager()`, `Model#undoFypManager()` and `Model#redoFypManager()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedFypManager` will be initialized with the initial FYP manager state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single FYP manager state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete -s i/A0123456A` command to delete student with studentId of A0123456A in the FYP manager. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitFypManager()`, causing the modified state of the FYP manager after the `delete -s i/A0123456A` command executes to be saved in the `fypManagerStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted FYP manager state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add -s n/David …​` to add a new student. The `add -s` command also calls `Model#commitFypManager()`, causing another modified FYP manager state to be saved into the `fypManagerStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitFypManager()`, so the FYP manager state will not be saved into the `fypManagerStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the student was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoFypManager()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous FYP manager state, and restores the FYP manager to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial FypManager state, then there are no previous FypManager states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoFypManager()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the opposite — it calls `Model#redoFypManager()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the FYP manager to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index `fypManagerStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest FYP manager state, then there are no undone FypManager states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoFypManager()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `Exit`. Commands that do not modify the FYP manager, such as `Exit`, will usually not call `Model#commitFypManager()`, `Model#undoFypManager()` or `Model#redoFypManager()`. Thus, the `fypManagerStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitFypManager()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `fypManagerStateList`, all FYP manager states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add n/David …​` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire FYP manager.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the student being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

#### Future Implementations
* Sorting of deadlines could be considered as well

###  `Exit` Feature
#### Proposed Implementation
The proposed `Exit` Feature allows the professor to exit the FYP Manager.
The `Exit` feature mechanism is facilitated by `ExitCommand`. It extends from the abstract class `Command`.
To summarize, it implements the following operation:
* `ExitCommand#execute()` — oversees the execution process for `ExitCommand`.

Given below is an example usage scenario of `ExitCommand`:
1. The user enters the `Exit` command.
2. `UiManager` calls `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()`.
3. `MainWindow#fillInnerParts()` executes a `executeCommand()` and creates a `CommandResult`.
4. `LogicManager` executes the `ExitCommand` using the `LogicManager#execute()` method.
   4.1. `FypManagerParser` will parse the command using `parseCommand` and generate
   4.2. `ExitCommand` then creates a `CommandResult` and returns it to `MainWindow` to complete the command.
   4.3. `StorageManager` will save the record using method `StorageManager#saveFypManager()`.
5. `handleExit()` is then executed to hide the main window.

The following sequence diagram shows how the list command works:

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* NUS SoC Professors taking on and managing FYP students doing projects using SoC
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: To provide a platform for easier access to SoC professors to their students’ FYP status, rather than via plain e-mail correspondences.
