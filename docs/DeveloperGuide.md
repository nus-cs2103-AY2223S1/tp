## Welcome to TaskBook!

TaskBook is a **desktop app for managing contacts and tasks, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, TaskBook can get your contact and task management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

This developer's guide consists of the following sections. Note that TaskBook is developed with Java 11.

## **Design**

### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of TaskBook.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/taskbook/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/taskbook/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data in JSON format to local storage.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `task delete i/1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/taskbook/ui/Ui.java)

<img src="images/UiClassDiagram.png" width="900">

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/taskbook/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/taskbook/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `TaskBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `ContactDeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `TaskBookParser` class detects the category that the command belongs to and calls upon the appropriate Category Parser (`ContactCategoryParser`, `TaskCategoryParser`, `CategorylessParser`).
* The Category Parser creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `ContactAddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `ContactAddCommand`) which results in the `TaskBookParser` returning a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `ContactAddCommandParser`, `ContactDeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/taskbook/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the task book data i.e., all `Person` objects which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` object, as well as `Task` objects which are contained in a `TaskList` a object.
* stores a subset of `Person` objects in the `UniquePersonList` (according to user filter query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a subset of `Task` objects in the `TaskList` (according to user filter query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed'.
* stores the `Task` objects in the _filtered_ list above (according to user sort query) as a _sorted_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Task>` that can be 'observed'.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T13-4/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/taskbook/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* saves contacts and tasks in JSON format to local storage, and reads them back into corresponding objects.
* saves user preferences in JSON format to local storage, and reads them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `TaskBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on corresponding classes in the `Model` component for serialization (converting objects to JSON format) and deserialization (recreating objects from JSON format).

### Common classes

Classes commonly used by multiple components are in the `taskbook.commons` package. This promotes reusable code that must be maintained with care as there may be multiple dependencies.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes details on how certain noteworthy features are implemented.

### Command History Navigation

#### Implementation

The command history navigation mechanism is facilitated by `CommandHistoryManager`, which is a concrete implementation of `CommandHistory`, that internally stores the current state with `commandsList` and `pointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommmand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Retrieves the previous command from its history.
* `CommandHistory#getNextCommmand()`â€‰â€”â€‰Retrieves the next command from its history.
* `CommandHistory#addCommand(String command)`â€‰â€”â€‰Adds a new command into its history.

The methods successfully handles edge cases where the command history is empty, full and when there are no more previous or next commands to navigate to.

`CommandHistoryManager` can be instantiated with an optional capacity, the default is as explained in the design considerations below. When the size of the command history exceeds double the allocated capacity, the older half of the history is pruned.

`LogicManager` will store an instance of `CommandHistoryManager`, which is used as follows:

* To detect key presses for `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys, set the `setOnKeyPressed` for the `commandTextField` on start up, which calls `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommmand()` and `CommandHistory#getNextCommmand()` respectively and updates the text displayed.
* When handling user input, call `CommandHistory#addCommand(commandText)` with the `commandText` in `CommandBox#handleCommandEntered()` to save the userâ€™s input into the command history. Even if the commands are invalid, save them into the history. This allows the user to fix the wrong commands and re-execute them.

![CommandHistoryActivityDiagram](images/CommandHistoryActivityDiagram.png)

Note: Some intermediate steps are omitted for simplicity. Full details are in the sequence diagram below.

Given below is an example of a usage scenario and how the command history mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. `CommandHistoryManager` will be initialized in `CommandBox`. The internal `commandsHistoryList` will be empty and the `commandsHistoryPointer` will point to the `0`th element, which represents the absence of a command. Attempting to retrieve this `0`th element would return an empty string instead.

Step 2. The user executes a few commands. Regardless whether these commands are valid or invalid, each of these inputs fires `CommandHistory#addCommand` once with their respective command texts.

Step 3. The user navigates to a previous command by clicking the `UP` arrow key. `CommandHistory#getPreviousCommmand()` will be called.

Step 4. The user navigates to a next command by clicking the `DOWN` arrow key. `CommandHistory#getNextCommmand()` will be called.

The following sequence diagram shows how the next command history navigation works, if there is a next command to navigate to:

![NextCommandHistorySequenceDiagram](images/NextCommandHistorySequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Saving invalid commands:**

* **Alternative 1 (chosen choice):** Invalid commands are saved in the command history.
    * Pros: Allows the user to navigate to an invalid command and rectify before re-executing it, so that the user does not have to retype the entire command.
    * Cons: Clutters the command history.

* **Alternative 2:** Invalid commands are not saved in the command history, only valid commands are saved.
    * Pros: Uses less memory, command history is not cluttered with incorrect commands.
    * Cons: Does not allow the user to access and rectify a previous incorrect command.

**Aspect: Saving empty commands:**

* **Current choice:** Empty commands are not saved in the command history.
    * Rationale: To not clutter the command history.

**Aspect: How many commands to be supported:**

* **Current choice:** 1000 commands.
    * Rationale: To keep memory usage low, minimise the number of commands saved in the history. 1000 commands is a reasonably large enough number of commands to store and is sufficient even for advanced users.

### Sorting Task List

#### Sorting Implementation

This section details how the sorting of tasks is implemented. The sorting of contacts is a slightly simplified version.

The sorting of tasks is facilitated by `ModelManager`. It implements `Model`, and contains a `filteredTasks` list which is the `TaskList` of TaskBook in a `FilteredList` 'wrapper' from `javafc.collections.transformation`.

A second field, `sortedTasks`, then stores `filteredTasks` wrapped in a `SortedList` from `javafx.collections.transformation`. Commands executed on `filteredTasks` will also be reflected in `sortedTasks` as the latter is the former in a `SortedList` wrapper.

`SortedList` implements the method `SortedList#setComparator(Comparator<? super E> comparator)` that takes in a comparator used to sort the tasks. The method `ModelManager#updateSortedTaskList(Comparator<Task> comparator)` is thus implemented to allow for setting of a comparator in `sortedTasks`.

When the sorting comparator is `null`, `sortedTasks` will be of the same order as `filteredTasks` in chronological order that the tasks were added in. By default, the sorting comparator is `null`.

The `Ui` displays the `sortedTasks` version of the task list by default on the right side panel.

#### Sorting Execution

When you enter `task sort s/SORT_TYPE`, the `Ui` sends the command to `Logic`. `Logic` then identifies the correct type `TaskSortCommand` that you entered, and creates an instance of it. Each `TaskSortCommand` contains a `comparator` to set in `sortedTasks` in the `Model`. `Logic` finally executes the command, which then correctly sets the comparator in `sortedTasks` in `Model`.

There is one sort command specifically for you to set the comparator to null. Do not directly set the comparator to null in other ways.

#### Example Usage

Given below is an example of a usage scenario and how the sorting mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1: The user launches the application, which already contains a task list from previous usage. `sortedList` will be initialized in `ModelManager`. The initial `comparator` in `sortedList` will be null, so the tasks are sorted by the date and time they were added.

Step 2: The user executes `task sort s/a` command to sort the tasks descriptions in alphabetical order. The `TaskSortCommandParser` uses `s/a` to determine that the command is a `TaskSortDescriptionAlphabeticalCommand`. This command calls `Model#updateSortedTaskList(Comparator<Task> comparator)`, which sets the comparator in `sortedTasks` to one that compares the strings of tasks, and the `Ui` displays the new ordering of the tasks given by `sortedTasks`, where tasks are alphabetically ordered by their descriptions.

Step 3: The user executes `task sort s/ca` command to sort the tasks by when they were added in task book. The `TaskSortCommandParser` uses `s/ca` to determine that the command is a `TaskSortAddedChronologicalCommand`. This command calls `Model#resetSortedTaskList()`, which sets the comparator in `sortedTasks` to null, and the `Ui` displays the new ordering of the tasks given by `sortedTasks`, which will be the same ordering as the one that would be given by `filteredTasks`.

The following sequence diagram shows how a sort by description alphabetical command is executed:

![SortDescriptionAlphabeticalSequenceDiagram.png](images/SortDescriptionAlphabeticalSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Sorting command structure:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Have an abstract sort command from which all other sort commands must inherit from.
    * Pros: Follows Open-Closed Principle
    * Cons: More code required
* **Alternative 2:** Have only 1 sort command that has multiple methods, and the parser will choose which to execute.
    * Pros: Less code required
    * Cons: Violates Open-Closed Principle

**Aspect: Sorted List structure:**

* **Current choice:** Wrap the task list in a `FilteredList`, and the `FilteredList` in a `SortedList`.
    * Rationale: Commands on the filtered list will also be reflected in the sorted list. This means that the `Ui` can display `sortedTasks`, which reflects both filter and sorting order.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedTaskBook`. It stores various `TaskBook` states with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `taskBookStateList` and `pointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedTaskBook#commit(TaskBook)`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current task book state in its history, if there are any changes in the state.
* `VersionedTaskBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous task book state from its history.
* `VersionedTaskBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone task book state from its history.

`VersionedTaskBook` can be instantiated with an optional capacity, the default is as explained in the design considerations below. When the size of the version history exceeds double the allocated capacity, the older half of the history is pruned.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitTaskBook()`, `Model#undoTaskBook()` and `Model#redoTaskBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example of a usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `VersionedTaskBook` will be initialized with the initial task book state, and the `pointer` pointing to that single task book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `contact delete i/5` command to delete the 5th person in the task book. The `contact delete i/5` command calls `Model#commitTaskBook()`, causing the modified state of the task book after the `contact delete i/5` command executes to be saved in the `taskBookStateList`, and the `pointer` is shifted to the newly inserted task book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `contact add n/David â€¦â€‹` to add a new person. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitTaskBook()`, causing another modified task book state to be saved into the `taskBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If a command fails its execution, it will not call `Model#commitTaskBook()`, so the task book state will not be saved into the `taskBookStateList`.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the person was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoTaskBook()`, which will shift the `pointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous task book state, and restores the task book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `pointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial TaskBook state, then there are no previous TaskBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoTaskBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather
than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoTaskBook()`, which shifts the `pointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the task book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `pointer` is at index `taskBookStateList.size() - 1`, pointing to the latest task book state, then there are no undone TaskBook states to restore. The `redo` command uses `Model#canRedoTaskBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `task sort s/a`. Commands that do not modify the task book, such as `task sort s/a`, will usually not call `Model#undoTaskBook()` or `Model#redoTaskBook()`. Thus, the `taskBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `task delete i/1`, which calls `Model#commitTaskBook()`. Since the `pointer` is not pointing at the end of the `taskBookStateList`, all task book states after the `pointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `contact add n/David â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire task book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the person being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

**Aspect: How many undo operations to be supported:**

* **Current choice:** 15 commands.
  * Rationale: With the current choice of execution, would have to store `x` copies of the task book for `x` operations supported. Thus, the number of operations is kept low to ensure that memory usage remains low.

**Aspect: How many redo operations to be supported:**

* **Current choice:** 15 commands.
    * Rationale: Since the current choice of undo operations to be supported is 15, the number of redo operations supported is also 15.

**Aspect: Invalid undo/redo operation:**

* **Current choice:** Show an error to the user in the UI.
    * Rationale: Alert the user of the invalid action, stemming from a lack of actions to undo/redo, so that the user is aware that the command is invalid.

### Mark/Unmark Task Command

#### Implementation

The mark and unmark task command mechanism is facilitated by `TaskMarkCommand` and `TaskUnmarkCommand` which extend `Command`, `TaskMarkCommandParser`, `TaskUnmarkCommandParser` and `EditTaskDescriptor`. 

Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `MarkTaskCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the chain of instructions to change the status of the task to done.
* `MarkTaskCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses user input and creates a TaskMarkCommand object.
* `UnmarkTaskCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes the chain of instructions to change the status of the task to undone.
* `UnmarkTaskCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses user input and creates a TaskUnmarkCommand object.

The methods will handle cases where the index from the user input is out of bounds. 

Note: Some interim steps are omitted for simplicity. Full details are in the sequence diagram below.

Given below is an example of a usage scenario for how the task mark command mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time.

Step 2: The user adds a task.

Step 3. The user executes the task mark command on the first task.

The steps can be applied to task unmark command in the same way.

The following sequence diagram shows how the task mark command works:

![TaskMarkCommandSequenceDiagram](images/TaskMarkCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

The task unmark command follows a similar sequence diagram.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Mutability of boolean isDone field:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Immutable isDone field in Task object.
    * Pros: Reuse the same component from task edit command, reducing chance of breaking.
    * Cons: Extra overhead as a new task is created when the user marks it as done.

* **Alternative 2:** Mutable isDone field in the Task object.
    * Pros: Less overhead as it will only involve changing the isDone field in the object.
    * Cons: Mutable field may result in regression with other components such as Storage and UI.

### Tagging/Untagging tasks

#### Implementation

The tagging feature is implemented through integrating the `Tag` class into the `Task` classes, as well as their 
command classes and parser classes. 

The `Parser` classes are modified to resolve for tags through the `ArgumentTokenizer.tokenize()` and `ParserUtil.parseTags()` 
methods to obtain `Set<Tag>`.

Each of the task command classes (`TaskAddCommand`, `TaskDeleteCommand`, `TaskEditCommand` etc.) accept the parsed set 
of `Tag` objects when initialized.

The task classes (`Todo` etc.) are also created with the set of `Tag` objects.

To locally store information about the tags, the `Set<Tag>` object is passed into a `JSONAdaptedTask` and stored
as individual `JSONAdaptedTag` objects. To load the tags into the application, the `JSONAdaptedTag`s are iterated through
and recreated into objects in memory through the `toModelType()` method.

#### Alternative Implementation 

An alternative implementation to consider may be through the use of individual commands to tag/untag a task.

In such a case, the tag and untag task mechanism is facilitated by `TaskTagCommand`, which extends from `Command`.

It implements the following operations:

* `TaskTagCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes and coordinates the necessary objects and methods to tag a task.
* `TaskTagCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Parses user input from UI and initializes a TaskTagCommand object.

Cases such as where the index from the user input is out of bounds, are handled by the methods.

Given below is an example of a usage scenario for how the `TaskTagCommand` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. 

Step 2: The user adds a task.

Step 3. The user tags their task with the command `task tag i/1 t/work`. 

The following sequence diagram shows how the `TaskTagCommand` works:

![TagTaskSequenceDiagram](images/TagTaskSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: Untagging tasks:**

* **Current choice:** Use the same command to untag a task but without the `t/` modifier, i.e. `task tag i/1`.
    * Rationale: Reduce unnecessary number of commands for both user and developer's mental health.

**Aspect: Saving empty tags:**

* **Current choice:** Empty tags are not saved.
    * Rationale: Does not unnecessarily clutter the number of tags saved to a task.
  
### Todo/Deadline/Event Task types

#### Implementation

The Todo, Deadline and Event task types is facilitated by `TaskList`. It extends `Task` with 3 specific task types. Additional features of each task type:

- `Todo`: Nil
- `Event`: Event Date
- `Deadline`: Deadline Date

#### Design Considerations:

**Aspect: `Task` superclass implementation**

* **Current choice:** Implement `Task` as an abstract class.
    * Rationale: Having the specific task types extend from `Task` allows `TaskList` to store them homogeneously. `Task` is made abstract as `Todo` Task type models a basic task without a concept of time.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* has a need to manage a significant number of contacts and task assignments to and from these contacts
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast
* prefers typing to mouse interactions
* is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: TaskBook is the most personalized method for NUS students to manage their tasks, by connecting tasks with the people they know. Through connections, students will be better able to manage the complicated web of tasks they are involved in from a day to day basis. TaskBook will only help with task management and does not currently provide services outside of task and contact management, like reminders and workspaces. TaskBook is optimized for CLI inputs.

### UI for Command History Navigation

1. Execute a few commands, preferably distinct ones. They need not be valid commands. Take note of the order of execution.

   * A quick way to test is to execute `1`, `12`, `123`, etc...

1. Ensure that the input field is selected and in focus. Press `UP` and `DOWN` arrow keys and ensure that the command history displayed is per the order of execution.


## **Appendix: Effort**

The general difficulty level of TaskBook was medium. As the project direction was chosen to morph AB-3, most of the components from AB-3, including Logic, UI, Model and Storage could be reused without needing any major revamps. However, the difficulty came in the form of additional features that were implemented above the existing AB-3 components. They will be further elaborated below in **Effort Required**.

### Challenges Faced

**Logic**
* Implementing inheritance structure for Sorting commands.
* Parsing all fields in `task find` to create one comparator that searches all fields.
* Implementing `VersionedTaskBook` to support `undo` and `redo` functionality.
* Integrating tags for tasks 

**Model**
* Implementing Sorting and Filtering of tasks and contacts.

**Storage**
* Storing and loading of Tasks which each has a dependency relationship with a contact.
* Storage and loading of Tasks while maintaining the `Todo`, `Event` and `Deadline` subclasses.

**Ui**
* Adding a task list display component.
* Changing window color scheme.
* Changing color scheme of list cells based on type of item in the cell.

### Effort Required
The focus of TaskBook was to introduce Task management features on top of contact management features in AB-3.
While AB-3 only deals with a single `Person` entity, TaskBook introduced the `Task` entity.
Although effort was saved through reusing and adapting components from AB-3, a substantial effort was still required to incorporate `Task`-specific methods into the program.
Furthermore, `Task` was made extensible to 3 specific entities, `Todo`, `Event` and `Deadline`, which each required their respective models and commands.

Trying to refactor parser was a challenge due to unfamiliarity with the AB-3 codebase. 
There were crucial details in the implementation such as the required whitespace before each prefix. 
Hence, we needed to adapt our idea to incorporate new features into this brownfield project. 
For example, we changed all index fields to require a `i/` prefix instead of the no prefix implementation from AB-3.

Mark and unmark command was a challenge because the models were implemented with immutable fields.
Having a mutable boolean field in a task model resulted in misbehavior with the GUI and storage.
We opted to create a new task object entirely when a mark or unmark command is executed as a workaround to this problem.

Integrating tags for tasks was also a challenge as many classes across the different components of the app (`Logic`, `Model`, `Storage`) 
had to be refactored slightly to accommodate a new tag field in a task. The parser classes also had to be changed and it was tricky 
figuring out how some of the parser methods could be modified to parse and return the set of tags.

Trying to parse the arguments for `task find` was also a big challenge, because there was a lot of possible combinations of fields we could use, but we managed to break up the command's execute method into several smaller methods that could be reused, thus not only saving lines of code and increasing code readability, but also applying SLAP.
Adding the SortedList components to the task list and contact list in `ModelManager` was also a challenge due to lack of information on the existence of such a class. Until that point, we did not know how to implement a sorting feature to our contact and task lists. However, upon learning of Observer design patterns, we found another project that used SortedList and understood what to do from there.

A significant part of the effort in storing and loading of Tasks was saved using Jackson's `@JsonTypeInfo` and `@JsonSubTypes` annotations. This allowed for Tasks in the `TaskList` to be saved and loaded in their actual subtypes.

Much effort was required to create `VersionedTaskBook` for the `undo` and `redo` functionality. Despite AB-3 having a proposed implementation of it, a substantial amount of effort was put in to ensure that it was durable and can withstand any possible commit. Extra effort was put in to ensure that commits to the version history are capped at a certain capacity and yet are fast.

Quality of life features like command history navigation and help command also took some effort. Effort had to be put in to ensure that these features are consistent and work as intended in various different scenarios. Even though these features are not core, they elevate the experience of the user.

It was also difficult learning JavaFX and CSS in order to design our GUI in the style we wanted it. It was also a struggle to learn how to use the Observer design pattern that was given by AB3. However, with a lot of trial and error, as well as feedback from close friends outside this project group, we managed to put together a Gui we can be proud of.

We thankfully avoided a lot of work conflicts where multiple people were stuck because of one person's portion being unimplemented because we recognised early on that work blockages were a huge risk factor. We therefore assigned strict deadlines for those vital features and thus reduced the number of work blockages that occurred.

### Achievements
* Working saving and loading of Tasks.
* Implemented effective task management system with finding and sorting features.
* Fully customised and good-looking GUI.
* Quality of life features like undoing, redoing, and command history navigation.
* Comprehensive help command.
