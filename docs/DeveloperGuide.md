### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.)

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram1.png)
![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram2.png)
![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram3.png)
![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram4.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The class diagram of Ui is split into the above four diagrams to make it look more organised.
</div>

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`, `StudentDescription` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* depends on the `CommandResult` returned by the executed commands to handle the Ui change for different commands.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call. 

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The delete command deletes the specified entity in the current list, which is `Student`, `Tutor` or `TuitionClass` list. Here we assume that the current list is the `Student` list.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

The class diagram below shows a broad overview of the model component. 
The certain details and dependencies between the `Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass` has been omitted for simplicity.
The class diagram for `Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass` can be found right after model class diagram.
<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

This is the full class diagram for `Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass`.

<img src="images/ClassDiagram.png" width="650" />

The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object), 
all `Tutor` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueTutorList` object) and all `TuitionClass` objects 
(which are contained in a `UniqueTuitionClassList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects, `Tutor` objects and `TuitionClass` objects 
(e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an 
unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>`, `ObservableList<Tutor>` and `ObservableList<TuitionClass>` respectively that 
can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** An alternative (arguably, a more OOP) model 
is given below. It has a `Tag` list in the `AddressBook`, which `Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass` references. 
This allows `AddressBook` to only require one `Tag` object per unique tag, instead of each , `Tutor` and 
`TuitionClass` needing their own `Tag` objects respectively. Again certain details and dependencies between the 
`Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass` has been omitted for simplicity. The class diagram between `Student`, `Tutor` 
and `TuitionClass` can be found above. <br>

<img src="images/BetterModelClassDiagram.png" width="450" />

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### \[Implemented\] Adding a student, tutor or class

#### Implementation

The add mechanism is facilitated by `AddCommand`. It extends `Command` with an enum type `Entity` representing the three different types of entities that can be added to the `Model`. Also, it stores the `Person` or `TuitionClass` instances to be added. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `AddCommand#of()`â€‰â€”â€‰Creates an `AddCommand` instance encapsulating the entity to be added.
* `AddCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes adding of the encapsulated `Person` or `Class` instances to the `Model`.

The `AddCommand#execute()` operation is exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#execute()`.

The parsing of the add command is facilitated by `AddCommandParser`. It extends `Parser<AddCommand>` implementing the following operations:

* `AddCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns an `AddCommand` instance encapsulating a `Person` or `Class` instance created from user input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the add mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized with an empty `AddressBook`.

Step 2. The user executes `add student n/David ...` to add a new student. `AddCommandParser#parse()` is called to handle
the user input and by calling `AddCommand#of()` internally, a new `AddCommand` instance encapsulating a new `Student` 
instance to be added to `Model` is instantiated. The `AddCommand#execute()` operation of this instance is then called, adding the `Student` instance to the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add operation works:

![AddSequenceDiagram](images/AddSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 3. The user executes `list student` to view the list of students he has added.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the add command:

![AddActivityDiagram](images/AddActivityDiagram.png)


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to handle the adding of class and person separating:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** An `AddCommand` instance has both `Person` and `TuitionClass` fields but only at most one can be non-null at a time.
    * Pros: Less cluttered.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Separate classes that extend `Command` for adding of class and person separately.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: More cluttered.

### \[Implemented\] Editing a student, tutor or class

#### Implementation

The edit mechanism is facilitated by `EditCommand`. It extends `Command` with an abstract class `EditDescriptor` 
representing an object that will store the details to edit the `Model` with and its implementing classes. Also, it stores 
the `Index` and `EditDescriptor` instances used in editing. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `EditCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes editing of the entity of the target index.
* `EditCommand#createEditedPerson()`â€‰â€”â€‰Creates a `Person` instance by applying the changes on a `Person` instance as dictated by a `EditDescriptor` instance.
* `EditCommand#createEditedClass()`â€‰â€”â€‰Creates a `Class` instance by applying the changes on a `Class` instance as dictated by a `EditDescriptor` instance.

The `EditCommand#execute()` operation is exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#execute()`.

The parsing of the edit command is facilitated by `EditCommandParser`. It extends `Parser<EditCommand>` implementing the following operations:

* `EditCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns an `EditCommand` instance encapsulating the `Index` and `EditDescriptor` instances created from user input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the edit mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized with an empty `AddressBook`.

Step 2. The user then executes `add student n/David ...` to add a new student. A `Student` instance is added to the `Model`.

Step 3. The user executes `edit 1 n/Tom ...` to edit the existing student.`EditCommandParser#parse()` is called to handle
the user input and a new `EditCommand` instance encapsulating the `Index` and `EditDescriptor` instances (instantiated based on the inputs of the user) is created.
The `EditCommand#execute()` operation of this instance is then called. Firstly, the `Student` to edit is identified using the `Index` instance.
Internally, `EditCommand#createEditedPerson()` is then called to return a new `Student` instance reflecting the changes 
dictated by the `EditDescriptor` and the original values of the existing `Student` instance. This new `Student` instance will replace the existing `Student` instance in the `Model`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the edit operation works:

![EditSequenceDiagram](images/EditSequenceDiagram.png)

Step 4. The description panel will then display the information of the edited student for the user to view the changes he has made.

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes the edit command:

![EditActivityDiagram](images/EditActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to handle the editing of class and person separating:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** An `EditCommand` instance has all implementations of the abstract class `EditDescriptor` such as `EditTuitionClassDescriptor` or `EditStudentDescriptor` for it to handle the editing of persons and classes.
    * Pros: Less cluttered.
    * Cons: Harder to implement.
* **Alternative 2:** Separate classes that extend `Command` for editing of class and person separately.
    * Pros: Easier to implement.
    * Cons: More cluttered.

### \[Implemented\] Adding a next of kin to a student

#### Implementation

The next of kin adding mechanism is facilitated by `NextOfKinCommand`. 
It extends `Command` and stores the `Index` and `NextOfKin` instances for adding the next of kin. 
Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `NextOfKinCommand#execute()`â€‰â€”â€‰Executes adding of the `NextOfKin` instance to a `Student` instance in the `Model`.

The `NextOfKinCommand#execute()` operation is exposed in the `Logic` interface as `Logic#execute()`.

The parsing of the next of kin command is facilitated by `NextOfKinCommandParser`. It extends `Parser<NextOfKinCommand>` implementing the following operations:

* `NextOfKinCommandParser#parse()`â€‰â€”â€‰Returns an `NextOfKinCommand` instance encapsulating the `Index` and `NextOfKin` instances created from user input.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the next of kin adding mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` will be initialized with an empty `AddressBook`.

Step 2. The user then executes `add student n/David ...` to add a new student. A `Student` instance is added to the `Model`.

Step 3. The user executes `nok 1 n/Tom ...` to add next of kin details to the existing student.`NextOfKinCommandParser#parse()` is called to handle
the user input and a new `NextOfKinCommand` instance encapsulating the `Index` and `NextOfKin` instances (instantiated based on the inputs of the user) is created.
The `NextOfKinCommand#execute()` operation of this instance is then called. Firstly, the `Student` in question is identified using the `Index` instance.
Next, the `NextOfKin` is added to the `Student` instance in question in the `Model`.

Step 4. The description panel will then display the information of the student for the user to view the changes he has made.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: When to add next of kin:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Separate command to add next of kin details.
    * Pros: Short command syntax.
    * Cons: More lines of code.
* **Alternative 2:** Add next of kin details through the Add command.
    * Pros: Less lines of code.
    * Cons: Long command syntax.

### \[Implemented\] Assign/unassign feature

#### Implementation

User would be required to input the command `assign` followed by the index of the person that the user want 
to assign a class to. Lastly, user would have to input the exact tuition class name in the following prefix 
and syntax `n/[Class Name]` to specify which tuition class they want to assign to the specified person.

The `assign` and `unassign` features requires the user to be currently be either in student or tutor list.
If the user is currently not in any of the two lists, the feature will not work and user would be prompted
to go to the valid current list through a `command exception`.

During the execution of `assign` command, it would first check for the type of current list the user is in
as mentioned above. If the current list is student list, the index of assign command would be referred to the
student list and same for if the current list is a tutor list. 

After, the index that the user inputted would be checked 
to see if it is within the size of the current list. If it exceeds the size of the list, a `command exception` would be 
thrown and user would be informed of their invalid index. 

Then with the tuition class name that the user inputted and parsed, it would
be searched among the list of tuition class for matching names. If there is no matching tuition class in the list, 
a `command exception` would be thrown and user would be informed that the tuition class they inputted does not exist.

If there is no `command exception` thrown due to the above scenarios, the tuition class would be assigned to the 
specified student/tutor.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `assign` operation works:
![AssignSequenceDiagram](images/AssignSequenceDiagram.png)

The `unassign` command just does the opposite - it calls `Student#unassignClassFromStudent`/ 
`Tutor#unassignClassFromTutor` instead which remove the specified tuition class from the list of
tuition classes in the student/tutor.

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How assign & unassign executes:**

* **Alternate 1 (current choice):** `assign`/`unassign` just involves adding / removing tuition class from 
  a list of tuition classes that every student/tutor has.
  * Pros: Easier to implement and store in Json format.
  * Cons: Not keeping a list of students and tutors for tuition classes may
  result in a more tedious process when searching in the future.
* **Alternate 2:** `assign`/`unassign` involves adding / removing tuition class from
  a list of tuition classes that every student/tutor has and as well as the tuition classes
  keeping a list of students and tutors it has. 
  * Pros: Makes searching process easier in the future.
  * Cons: Hard and tedious to implement the storing of information in Json. 


### \[Implemented\] Search by multiple fields feature

#### Implementation

The proposed find by fields mechanism searches the currently displayed list based on multiple fields by taking in a set of prefixes with their respective keywords and updating the respective `FilteredList`.

The following activity diagram shows how the `find` operation works:
![FindActivityDiagram](images/FindActivityDiagram.png)

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the find by fields mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `ModelManager` would be initialised and the type is set to the default list type which is `STUDENT_LIST`.

Step 2. The user execute `list tutor` command to list out all tutors by calling `ListTutorCommand`. The `ListTutorCommand` calls `Model#updateCurrentListType()` with `TUTOR_LIST` being the parameter, causing the type in `ModelManager` to update to `TUTOR_LIST`.

Step 3. The user executes `find n/john q/computing i/nus` command to search for all tutors who are named John and have graduated from NUS with computing qualifications. The user's input is first parsed into the `AddressBookParser`, where the `COMMAND_WORD` and the `arguments` are separated, and the `Model.ListType` is determined.

Step 4. After checking that the `COMMAND_WORD` is `find`, a new `FindCommandParser` is returned with the `arguments` parsed into it.

Step 5. In the `FindCommandParser`, the `arguments` are tokenized into an `ArgumentMultimap`, where the respective `prefixes` and `keywords` are extracted from the `arguments` and mapped to each other. Following that, `validateArguments` is executed to ensure that the arguments are valid.

Step 6. Afterwards, the pairs of `prefixes` and `keywords` are put into a `HashMap<Prefix, String>`, and a `FindCommand` is then returned with the `HashMap<Prefix, String>` parsed into it.

Step 7. In the `FindCommand`, a `TutorContainsKeywordsPredicate<Tutor>` is created with the `keywords` as input, which tests if the `keywords` are contained by the respective fields in the tutors.

Step 8. Afterwards, the `filteredList` of tutors is updated with that `TutorContainsKeywordsPredicate<Tutor>` in the `ModelManager`. A new `CommandResult` is then returned and a list of tutors with that predicate is then shown.

Step 9. The user now decides he wants to be more specific with his search, and decides to execute `find n/John Doe q/bachelor of computing i/nus` to find all tutors who are named John Doe, and have graduated from NUS with a bachelor's degree in computing. A more specific list of students is will be shown.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `find` operation works:
![FindSequenceDiagram](images/FindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Proposed implementations / add-ons ####

#### 1. Filter feature ####

The `find` feature works very similarly to a "filter" feature, where the list of items is reduced to fit a set of criteria. Currently, the feature "finds" students, tutors or tuition classes by checking if the respective fields contains a keyword string. 
However, many of the field classes of each entity are implemented as enums, where the values of the enums are constant and predictable. For example, the `Day` class has enum values such as `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday` etc. 
In such cases, users can input keywords like "day" that matches every single possible enum value for this class, which ends up fulfilling the predicate for every entity on the list.

Therefore, we could let the user use the feature as a "filter", where the user cannot simply input a partial search keyword such as "Mon" and check if the value of the actual `Day` object is a `Monday`. Instead, the user has to input the entire enum value as a filter (e.g. `Monday`) in order for the
function to pass through. Below are some considerations for this approach:

Pros:
- Blocks off unintended use cases, such as giving the input "day" that matches every single entity on the list.
- Reduces unintended errors by limiting the inputs that the user can give. E.g. Can only input `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday` etc. for the `Day` field

Cons:
- Much more inflexible as users cannot give inputs that are more lenient and that matches more entities on the list.
- It would be much more troublesome to use on a CLI-centric application as users may have to key in the full spelling of the filter being applied.

Alternatively, the filter feature can be implemented as a separate feature altogether in future iterations.

#### 2. Add more fields for find feature ####

The find feature currently doesn't allow users to search by the following criteria:

Student:
1. Details of `NextOfKins`
2. Details of `TuitionClass` that they are attending

Tutor:
1. Details of `TuitionClass` that they are teaching

TuitionClass:
1. Details of `Student` that are attending
2. Details of `Tutor` that are teaching

These could be added in future iterations to give users more flexibility in their search.

#### 3. Add interactive UI interactions ####

The find feature is currently a full CLI-centric feature, where users have to key in the command in the correct format to execute the command.
While the application was indeed intended for fast typists, we could consider adding elements of UI interaction to accommodate more user preferences.
For example, we can implement clickable elements to allow users to select a set of "commonly used searches" so that they don't have to re-type predicates that they frequently use.
Furthermore, we can add individual search boxes for each searchable field so that it is much more intuitive for the users to input their predicates.
Therefore, there is a lot of potential for UI to be integrated with the find feature in future iterations.

### \[Implemented\] List type feature

#### Implementation

The list type feature is motivated by the existence of the three different entities that are monitored by myStudent, namely `Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass`. 
It is implemented as an enum class `ListType` in the `Model` which includes three values: `STUDENT_LIST`, `TUTOR_LIST` and `TUITIONCLASS_LIST`. 

The current list type is kept as a `ListType` field `type` in the `ModelManager` which implements the `Model`. 
The `Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass` instances are stored in the `filteredStudent`, `filterdTutors` and `filterdTuitionClass` respectively in the `ModelManager`, and the `type` field in the `ModelManager` indicates which of the three would be operated on by the `Logic` component when a certain command is executed. 
Additionally, to allow access by the `Logic` component, the `Model` implements setter and getter methods for the `type`:

* `Model#updateCurrentListType()` - Updates the `type` to the specified list type.
* `Model#getCurrentListType()` - Returns the `type` that the `ModelManager` currently stores.
* `Model#getCurrentList()` - Returns the current filtered list from the `filteredStudents`, `filteredTutors` and `filteredTuitionClass` directly according to the current list type.

The operations are exposed to the `Logic` interface as `Logic#updateCurrentListType()`, `Logic#getCurrentListType()` and `Logic#getCurrentList()` respectively. Since the `Ui` keeps a reference to the `Logic`, these operations can be accessed by the `Ui` as well.

The `ListType` field `type` in the `ModelManager` is referred to by any method that needs to access to the type of the current list. Given below is an example usage scenario including the `ListTutorCommand` and how the list type mechanism behaves in each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `ModelManager` would be initialised and the `type` is set to the default list type which is the `STUDENT_LIST`.

Step 2. The user executes `list tutor` command to list out tutors by calling `ListTutorCommand`. The `ListTutorCommand` calls `Model#updateCurrentListType()` with the `TUTOR_LIST` being the parameter, causing the `type` field in the `ModelManager` to update to the `TUTOR_LIST`. 

Step 3. The command then returns a `commandResult` with its `commandType` field being `LIST`. This will cause calling `commandResult.isList()` to return true. 

Step 4. The `commandResult` is then returned to the `commandResult` in the `executeCommand()` method in the `MainWindow`. The `executeCommand()` method then checks that `commandResult.isList()` returns true and calls `MainWindow#handleList()`.

Step 5. The `handleList()` method checks the `type` in the `ModelManager` with `Logic#getCurrentListType()`. Since the `type` is set to the `TUTOR_LIST`, `MainWindow#handleList()` will clear the children of the `entityListPanelPlaceholder`, and add the `tutorListPanel` to it, which holds the `Tutor` list. 
This will update the Ui to display the `Tutor` list.

Step 6. The `handleList()` method then calls `setLabelStyle()`. Similar to `handleList()`, `setLabelStyle()` calls `Logic#getCurrentListType()` to get the `type` in the `ModelManager` and set the style class of the `tutorLabelPanel` to `SELECTED_CLASS_LABEL_STYLE_CLASS`, and the `studentLabelPanel` along with the `tuitionClassLabelPanel` to `UNSELECETED_LABEL_STYLE_CLASS`. 
This will update the Ui such that the `List Tabs` on top of the `List Display Panel` in Ui will highlight the current displayed list, the `Tutor` list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `list` operation works:
![ListSequenceDiagram](images/ListSequenceDiagram.png)

### \[Implemented\] Sort Command
The sort command allows users to sort the respective list from Oldest to the Newest entry, Alphabetically or in Reverse order.  
Sorting by default means sorting by oldest to newest updated entry. Editing an entry is considered updating it.  
__Proposed implementation__: sort by class timings and levels.

#### Implementation

<img src="images/SortSequenceDiagram.png">
The above is the sequence diagram for the case where the user inputs `sort alpha` in the command box.

Since the list displayed is linked to each `Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass` internal list through an observer, we can just sort it and the displayed list will be updated accordingly. The list to be sorted will be the one that is currently displayed in the UI. `SortCommand` will know this using `ModelManager::getCurrentListType`.  
Sorting by default and alphabetical order is done using the `.sort(Comparator<? super E>)` method of a list, where default uses a custom-defined comparator, and sorting in reverse is done using `java.util.Collections`.

**Remarks:**  
In the method for default sorting, `uniqueId` has 2 values, the time when the entry was added, and the sequence number it was added in. Their keys are the `Integer` `0` and `1` respectively. This was done because myStudent loads  data from the .json files instantly during startup i.e. the method to capture the time, `Instant.now()`, is not precise enough. Thus, their sequence number is used instead to sort.


#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How to save the order of the entries since the time/date an entry was entered is not stored.**

* **Alternative 1:** Store entries in a separate list, `OrderedList`.
    - A new entry will first be added to `OrderedList`.
    - `internalList` will then copy the `OrderedList`.
    - when the user wants to sort the list in alphabetical or reverse order, `internalList` will be sorted accordingly.
    - To sort by default, `internalList` just copies the current `OrderedList`.


* **Alternative 2:** Store the order of entries as a field in their respective objects.
    - Have a static field to count the number of `Student`, `Tutor` and `TuitionClass` instances.
    - When a new entry is added, it'll contain a `uniqueId` field, which contains the time and the order the entry was added in.
    - When the user wants to sort by default, the comparator can use this `uniqueId` to compare 2 instances.

## **Appendix: Effort**

This project had a higher difficulty level than AB3 as we had to deal with 3 entity types which are Student, Tutor and 
TuitionClass while AB3 had only one entity type. We had to tweak a lot of the existing variables and methods to ensure that
existing commands works for each of the entity types we were implementing as well as fixing the broken test cases and 
implementing new ones.

We also put in more effort in improving the find feature such that now the find command is able to search for multiples
fields compared to previously where AB3 only allow searching by name. We also add the ability to allow user to be able
to export the address books in myStudent to .csv files which took a considerable amount of research and time for the
implementation to ensure it is working.

Significant time and effort was also put in on designing and implementing the UI part of the project such as adding an 
introduction and ending screen and the ability for user to change themes.
