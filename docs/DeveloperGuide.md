### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java) It is
responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `deleteq 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified
in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `StudentListPanel`,

`QuestionListPanel`, `TutorialListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the
abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Student`, `Question` and `Tutorial` objects
* residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddStuCommand`) which
   is executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a student).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("deletestu 1")`
API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `deletestu 1` Command](images/DeleteStuSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteStuCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddStuCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to
  parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddStuCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns
  back as a `Command` object.

* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddStuCommandParser`, `DeleteStuCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component

**
API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

![Model class Diagram](images/ModelClassDiagram.png)

The `Model` component,

* stores the seta
* data i.e., all `Student` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueStudentList` object), all
  `Question` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueQuestionList` object), all `Tutorial` objects (which are contained
  in a `UniqueTutorialList` object)
* stores the currently 'selected' `Student` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list
  which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Student>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be
  bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list change. The same applies
  to `Question`
  objects with `ObservableList<Question>`, and `Tutorial` objects with `ObservableList<Tutorial>`
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T08-4/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both seta data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Add Student feature

The Add Student feature allows CS2103T TAs to add a new `Student` object to the student list. When successfully added,
the student will be added on the Graphical User Interface.

#### Implementation

The Add Student mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#hasStudent(Student s)` - Returns true if a student with the same identity as Student's exists in seta.
* `AddressBook#addStudent(Student student)` - Adds a student to the seta.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#hasStudent(Student student)`
and `Model#addStudent(Student student)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addstu` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialised with the initial
json data stored.

Step 2. The user execute `addstu n/John Doe...` command to add student called John Doe to the seta. The `addstu`
command calls `AddStuCommandParser#parse()` which parses the string keyed into the command line of the GUI.

Step 3. `AddStuCommandParser#parse()` invokes the creation of an `AddStuCommand` object.

**Note:** If a command fails its execution due to incorrect command format, it will not create a `AddStuCommand` object,
User will retype their command.

Step 4. Upon creation of `AddStuCommand` object, `Model#hasStudent(Student student)`
and `Model#addStudent(Student student)`
methods are called.

**Note:** If upon invoking `Model#hasStudent(Student s)` method and return value is `true`, it will not
call `Model#addStudent(Student student)`, so the student will not be added into the student list as student already
exist in the list.

Step 5. After successfully adding student to the student list, a `CommandResult` object will be created to tell the user
that the student has been successfully added.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add student operation works:

![AddStuSequenceDiagram](images/AddStuSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddStuCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `addstu` command.

![AddStuActivityDiagram](images/AddStuActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How AddStu executes::**

- **Alternative 1**: Require user to key in response and attendance number in when adding student
    - Pros: More details of a student can be viewed right after adding a student
    - Cons: Troublesome for CS2103T TAs to add a student quickly as many details have to be keyed in if what they want
      is to just keep track of the students name and contact name.
- **Alternative 2**: Only name, telegram handle and email needs to be keyed in when adding student
    - Pros: Faster to add a student
    - Cons: CS2103T TA has to use another command to change the response and attendance number of the student.

### Add Response feature

The `AddResponse` feature allows users to edit the response count of a `Student` object. When successfully edited, the
response count will be updated on the Graphical User Interface.

#### Implementation

The response mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueStudentList`. It is stored internally as a `Response` along with other
attributes of a `Student`. It is first initialized upon creation of a `Student` object and set as a `null`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the response mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniqueStudentList` will be initialized with the
initial json data stored.

Step 2. The user executes `addresponse 1 m/7` command to add a response count to the first student in the
one-indexed `UniqueStudentList`. The `addresponse` command will call `AddResponseCommandParser#parse()`.

**Note:**

1. If the index given is not a valid index (ie, out of bounds or negative), it will return an error to the user rather
   than attempting to execute the command.
2. If the review is missing an `index`, or a category (`m/`), `AddResponseCommandParser` will throw an `ParseException`
   to the user with an error message specifying that the command parameters are incorrect, and an example usage of the
   command.

Step 3. `AddResponseCommandParser` returns an `AddResponseCommand` with the newly created `Response` as a parameter.

Step 4. `AddResponseCommand` calls `Model#setStudent` and `Model#updateFilteredStudentList` to edit the response
attribute of the `Student`.

Step 5. After successfully editing the response attribute, `AddResponseCommand` will return the `CommandResult` to the
`Ui`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add response feature is executed:

![AddResponseSequenceDiagram](images/AddResponseSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddResponseCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

![AddResponseActivityDiagram](images/AddResponseActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How AddResponse executes:**

- **Alternative 1**: Only the number of responses on zoom recorded
    - Pros: Easy to implement
    - Cons: No check on quality of messages sent, which might be factored in to give participation marks for CS2103T
- **Alternative 2**: Number of responses and content of responses on zoom recorded
    - Pros: More comprehensive, users can check the quality of responses to award participation marks correspondingly
    - Cons: More memory consumed, takes quite long to implement on top of other features to be implemented in 4 weeks
      before feature freeze.

### Add Question feature

#### Implementation

The proposed add question mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#hasQuestion(Question question)` - Returns true if a question with the same identity as Question question
  exists in the seta.

* `AddressBook#addQuestion(Question question)` - Adds a question to the question list in seta.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#hasQuestion(Question question)`
and `Model#addQuestion(Question question)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the addq mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialised with the initial state.

Step 2. The user execute `addq Why?` command to add question called "Why?" to the question list ('UniqueQuestionList').
The `addq` command calls `Model#setAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook addressBook)`, causing the modified seta
after the `addq Why?` command executes to be saved in the `addressBook`.

**Note:**

1. If a command fails its execution
   due to incorrect command format, it will not call `Model#setAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook addressBook)`,
   so the seta state will not be saved into `addressBook`. User will retype their command.
2. If upon invoking `AddressBook#hasQuestion`
   method and return value is `true`, it will not call `Model#setAddressBook(ReadOnlyAddressBook addressBook)`,
   so 'UniqueQuestionList' and `addressBook` will not be updated.
3. Questions added not case-sensitive. For
   example, if a question in the `question list` is "why?", another question called "WHY?" can be added. Duplicates are
   not allowed. E.g. adding another question called "why?".

The following sequence diagram shows how the add question operation works:

![AddQSequenceDiagram](images/AddQSequenceDiagram.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `addq` command.

![AddQActivityDiagram](images/AddQActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design considerations:

**Aspect: How addq executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the question inside seta.
    * Pros: Easy to implement.
    * Cons: If the data file is corrupted, all questions added are lost.

* **Alternative 2:** Add questions to a separate list not part of seta.
    * Pros: Easier to test as data is stored separately.
    * Cons: Having separate lists will cause the code to be more complicated.

_{more aspects and alternatives to be added}_

### Add Attendance feature

#### Implementation

The proposed add attendance mechanism is facilitated by `UniqueStudentList`. It is stored internally as an `Attendance`
along with other attributes of a `Student`. It is first initialized upon creation of a `Student` object and set as `0`.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the attendance machanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `UniqueStudentList` will be initialized with the
initial Json data stored.

Step 2. The user executes `attendance 1` command to increment the attendance of the 1st student in the one-indexed
`UniqueStudentList`. The `attendance` command calls `AttendanceCommandParser#parse()`).

**Note:**

1. If the index given is not a valid index (ie, out of bounds or negative), it will return an error to the user.
2. If the resulting attendance is not a valid number (ie, out of bounds or negative), it will return an error to the
   user.

Step 3. `AttendanceCommandParser` returns and `AttendanceCommand` with the newly created `Attendance` as a parameter.

Step 4. `AttendanceCommand` calls `Model#setStudent` and `Model#updateFilteredStudentList` to edit the attendance
attribute of the `Student`.

Step 5. After successfully editing the attendance attribute, `AttendanceCommand` will return the `CommandResult` to the
`Ui`.

The following sequence diagram shows how the attendance feature is executed.

![AttendanceSequenceDiagram](images/AttendanceSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddStuCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

![AttendanceSequenceDiagramReferenceFrame](images/AttendanceSequenceDiagramReferenceFrame.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new `attendance` command.

![AttendaceActivityDiagram](images/AttendanceActivityDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How Attendance executes:**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Increment attendance of student by 1.
    - Pros: Easy to implement
    - Cons: We are unable to decrement attendance. The workaround to this is by the `editstu` command to change the
      attendance to a value input by user.
- **Alternative 2:** Increment or decrement attendance of student by taking in a sign and a value.
    - Pros: Attendance can be modified easily.
    - Cons: Implementation is relatively complicated and require more exception handling.

### Add Tutorial feature

The Add Tutorial feature allows CS2103T TAs to add a new `Tutorial` object to the tutorial list. When successfully
added,
the tutorial will be added on the Graphical User Interface.

#### Implementation

The Add Tutorial mechanism is facilitated by `AddressBook`. It implements the following operations:

* `AddressBook#hasTutorial(Tutorial t)` - Returns true if a tutorial with the same identity as Tutorial t exists in seta.
* `AddressBook#addTutorial(Tutorial tutorial)` - Adds a tutorial to seta.

These operations are exposed in the Model interface as `Model#hasTutorial(Tutorial tutorial)`
and `Model#addTutorial(Tutorial tutorial)` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the `addtut` mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `AddressBook` will be initialised with the initial
json data stored.

Step 2. The user execute `addtut g/T08...` command to add tutorial called T08 to seta. The `addtut`
command calls `AddTutorialCommandParser#parse()` which parses the string keyed into the command line of the GUI.

Step 3. `AddTutorialCommandParser#parse()` invokes the creation of an `AddTutorialCommand` object.

**Note:** If a command fails its execution due to incorrect command format, it will not create a `AddTutorialCommand` object,
User will retype their command.

Step 4. Upon creation of `AddTutorialCommand` object, `Model#hasTutorial(Tutorial tutorial)`
and `Model#addTutorial(Tutorial tutorial)`
methods are called.

**Note:** If upon invoking `Model#hasTutorial(Tutorial s)` method and return value is `true`, it will not
call `Model#addTutorial(Tutorial tutorial)`, so the tutorial will not be added into the tutorial list as tutorial
already
exist in the list.

Step 5. After successfully adding tutorial to the tutorial list, a `CommandResult` object will be created to tell the
user
that the tutorial has been successfully added.

The following sequence diagram shows how the add tutorial operation works:
![AddTutSequenceDiagram](images/AddTutorialSequenceDiagram.png)
<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `AddTutorialCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

## **Appendix: Requirements**

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* CS2103T Teaching Assistants managing one or more tutorials
* has a need to manage a significant amount of tasks in a week other than their tutorials
* prefer desktop apps over other types
* can type fast and is reasonably comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**: They have difficulties keeping track of their student's and tutorial's details as well as
collating questions asked by their students. The UI of the current application(s) that they are using is not
aesthetically pleasing and intuitive enough.

otherwise)

****


**Use case: Add a student**

**MSS**

1. User enters the details to add a student.
2. SETA adds the student with his or her details into the student list.
   Use case ends.

**Extensions**

* 1a. SETA detects an error in the entered data.
    * 1a1. SETA requests for the correct data.
