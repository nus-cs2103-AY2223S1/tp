# **SoCompiler Developer Guide**

SoCompiler is a **desktop app for managing contacts and module information, optimized for use via a [Command Line Interface](#command-line-interface-cli) 
(CLI)** while still having the benefits of a [Graphical User Interface](#graphical-user-interface-gui) (GUI). 
It is built specifically for [School of Computing](#school-of-computing-soc) (SOC) students in NUS but can also be used by other students from NUS.

This developer guide will expose the architecture behind SoCompiler and showcase the specifics of how commands are handled by the application.

In order to be a successful SoCompiler Developer, you need a general understanding of:

* Java language
* JavaFx

## 2. **Design**

SoCompiler aims to provide features that are intuitive and simple to use. Keeping this in mind, 
we pursed an iterative approach, adding new features amidst evolving requirements. 
This gives rise to the following main guiding principles for SoCompiler:

**Maintainability**

This project is built upon an application called [AddressBook Level 3 (AB3)](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/), 
which follows the Model View Controller(MVC) design pattern. 
Ab3 was developed in a manner that facilitates easy modification. 
We capitalised on this fact and built upon existing components in AB3, such as [UI](#22-ui-component), 
[Logic](#23-logic-component), [Model](#24-model-component) and [Storage](#25-storage-component).

**Command Line Interface (CLI) Oriented**

As our target audience is SOC students who usually type fast and are familiar with command line interfaces, 
we designed SoCompiler to be more efficient at managing contacts and module information using commands compared to other apps in the market.

### 2.1. Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes
called [`Main`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/Main.java)
and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/MainApp.java). 
It is responsible for,

* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#26-common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#22-ui-component): The [User Interface](#user-interface) (UI) of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#23-logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#24-model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#25-storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.

**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues
the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *[Application Programming Interface](#application-programming-interface) (API)*  in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding
  API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using
the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component
through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the
implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.2. UI component

**API** : [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `PersonListPanel`
, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures
the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that
are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of
the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/ui/MainWindow.java)
is specified
in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Person` object residing in the `Model`.

[Back to Top](#socompiler-developer-guide)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.3. Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:

1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `AddressBookParser` class to parse the user command.
1. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is
   executed by the `LogicManager`.
1. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add a person).
1. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API
call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `DeleteCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="800"/>

How the parsing works:

* When called upon to parse a user command, the `AddressBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a
  placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse
  the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `AddressBookParser` returns back as
  a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser`
  interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

[Back to Top](#socompiler-developer-guide)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.4. Model component

**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="1000" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the address book data i.e., all `Person` or `Module` objects (which are contained in a `UniquePersonList` or
  a `UniqueModuleList` object respectively).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Person` or `Module` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _
  filtered_ list which is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Person>` or `ObservableList<Module>`
  that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the
  list change.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the user’s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as
  a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they
  should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

[Back to Top](#socompiler-developer-guide)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 2.5. Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/se-edu/addressbook-level3/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,

* can save both address book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding
  objects.
* inherits from both `AddressBookStorage` and `UserPrefStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only
  the functionality of only one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects
  that belong to the `Model`)

[Back to Top](#socompiler-developer-guide)

### 2.6. Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.addressbook.commons` package.

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## 3. **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### 3.1. Module Class

The [`Module`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W12-1/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/address/model/module) Class
facilitates the storing of various information related to a student's module that he/she is currently taking.

A `Module` Class contains

* A `ModuleCode`
* `TutorialDetails`
* `LectureDetails`
* A lecture `ZoomLink`
* A tutorial `ZoomLink`
* `AssignmentDetails`

All fields except `ModuleCode` are optional since not every `Module` will have details for every field. Empty fields are
represented by empty strings. Users can later modify the fields using the `EditCommand`.

All the commands associated with the `Module` Class would have the keyword "Module" in their class name. For example,
the command to add a `Module` is referred to as a `AddModuleCommand`.

All the `Module` objects are contained in a `UniqueModuleList` object which ensures that no duplicate `Module` objects
can exist in the `UniqueModuleList` object. This is because
in NUS, there are no two [modules](#modules) with the same module code. Thus, the notion of equality is defined by default to be
two `Module` objects containing the same `ModuleCode` object.

All the classes contained within the `Module` Class all have a regex that checks for whether the user input for the
specific field is valid.

For the five classes,

* The `ModuleCode` should only contain alphanumeric characters and spaces, and it should not be blank.
* The `ZoomLink` should be either blank, or a valid URL.
* `AssignmentDetails` should not be blank if added.

<img src="images/ModuleClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

[Back to Top](#socompiler-developer-guide)

### 3.2. Add Module feature

The AddModule commands extends `Command`, and takes in a `moduleCode`, `lectureDetails`, `tutorialDetails`, `zoomLink`
and multiple optional `assignmentDetails` to be added. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `AddModuleCommand#execute()`— Adds the corresponding module to the model.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#addModule()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario, and an object diagram to show the objects created during this command.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `ReadOnlyAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book
state.

Step 2. The user executes `addm m/CS1101S` command to add a module with the corresponding details in the address book.

* The `addm` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which creates a `AddModuleCommandParser`.
* The `AddModuleCommandParser` then tokenizes the user input string and returns an `ArgumentMultimap` object that maps
  prefixes to their respective argument values.
* Methods in `ParserUtil` is are then called to parse each individual object obtained from the `ArgumentMultimap` using
  their corresponding parsers.
* Then, a new `Module` with the corresponding details is created.
* After creating the `Module`, an `AddModuleCommand` is created, which calls `Model#addModule()`,
  and adds the newly created module to the model object.

The following object diagram illustrates the above example:
![AddModuleObjectDiagram](images/AddModuleObjectDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the AddModule operation works:
![AddModuleSequenceDiagram](images/AddModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.3. Delete Module feature

The DeleteModule commands extends `Command`, and takes in an `Index` to be deleted. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `DeleteModuleCommand#execute()`— Deletes the corresponding item in the given model according to the given index.

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#deleteModule()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario, and an object diagram to show the objects created during this command.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `ReadOnlyAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `deletem 1` command to delete the 1st module in the address book.

* The `deletem` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which creates a `DeleteModuleCommandParser`.
* The `DeleteModuleCommandParser` gets the `Index` to be deleted, which is 1 in this case, and creates a `DeleteModuleCommand`.
* `DeleteModuleCommand` then calls `Model#deleteModule()`, and deletes the module from the model object corresponding to the number parsed.

The following object diagram illustrates the above example:

![DeleteModuleObjectDiagram](images/DeleteModuleObjectDiagram.png)

The following sequence diagram shows how the DeleteModule operation works:

![DeleteModuleSequenceDiagram](images/DeleteModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

</div>

[Back to Top](#socompiler-developer-guide)

<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>

### 3.4. Find Module feature

The FindModule command extends `Command`, and takes in an `ModuleDetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate` to filter the module list by. Additionally, it implements the following operation:

* `FindModuleCommand#execute()`

This operation is exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#updateFilteredModuleList()`.

Given below is an example usage scenario.

Step 1. The user launches the application. The `ReadOnlyAddressBook` will be initialized with the initial address book state.

Step 2. The user executes `findm CS2100` command to filter the module list by `CS2100`.

* The `findm CS2100` command calls `AddressBookParser#parseCommand()`, which creates a `FindModuleCommandParser`.
* The `FindModuleCommandParser` instantiates a `ModuleDetailsContainsKeywordsPredicate` with the given keyword `CS2100`.
* The `FindModuleCommandParser` then creates a `FindModuleCommand` with the keyword.
* The `FindModuleCommand` then calls `Model#updateFilteredModuleList()` and filter the list to contain only [Modules](#modules) with the given keyword in their module code.

The following sequence diagram shows how the FindModule operation works:

![FindModuleSequenceDiagram](images/FindModuleSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** The lifeline for `FindModuleCommandParser` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

## 7. **Appendix B: Instructions for manual testing**

Given below are instructions to test the app manually.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** These instructions only provide a starting point for testers to work on;
testers are expected to do more *exploratory* testing.

</div>

### 7.1. Launch and shutdown

1. Initial launch

    1. Download the jar file and copy into an empty folder

    2. Double-click the jar file Expected: Shows the GUI with a set of sample contacts. The window size may not be
       optimum.

2. Saving window preferences

    1. Resize the window to an optimum size. Move the window to a different location. Close the window.

    2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: The most recent window size and location is retained.

### 7.2. Deleting a person

1. Deleting a person while all persons are being shown

    1. Prerequisites: List all persons using the `list` command. Multiple persons in the list.

    2. Test case: `delete 1`<br>
       Expected: First contact is deleted from the list. Details of the deleted contact shown in the status message.
       Timestamp in the status bar is updated.

    3. Test case: `delete 0`<br>
       Expected: No person is deleted. Error details shown in the status message. Status bar remains the same.

    4. Other incorrect delete commands to try: `delete`, `delete x`, `...` (where x is larger than the list size)<br>
       Expected: Similar to previous.

### 7.3. Saving data

1. Dealing with missing/corrupted data files

    1. Open the save file `SoCompiler.json` located in the file `data` and add garbage values. For example, add `!` or `-` to a persons' contact number.
    2. Re-launch the app by double-clicking the jar file.<br>
       Expected: App opens with no person or module loaded. Save file is wiped clean.
