### Architecture

<img src="images/ArchitectureDiagram.png" width="280" />

The ***Architecture Diagram*** given above explains the high-level design of the App.

Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other.

**Main components of the architecture**

**`Main`** has two classes called [`Main`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/application/Main.java) and [`MainApp`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/application/MainApp.java). It is responsible for,
* At app launch: Initializes the components in the correct sequence, and connects them up with each other.
* At shut down: Shuts down the components and invokes cleanup methods where necessary.

[**`Commons`**](#common-classes) represents a collection of classes used by multiple other components.

The rest of the App consists of four components.

* [**`UI`**](#ui-component): The UI of the App.
* [**`Logic`**](#logic-component): The command executor.
* [**`Model`**](#model-component): Holds the data of the App in memory.
* [**`Storage`**](#storage-component): Reads data from, and writes data to, the hard disk.


**How the architecture components interact with each other**

The *Sequence Diagram* below shows how the components interact with each other for the scenario where the user issues the command `delete 1`.

<img src="images/ArchitectureSequenceDiagram.png" width="574" />

Each of the four main components (also shown in the diagram above),

* defines its *API* in an `interface` with the same name as the Component.
* implements its functionality using a concrete `{Component Name}Manager` class (which follows the corresponding API `interface` mentioned in the previous point.

For example, the `Logic` component defines its API in the `Logic.java` interface and implements its functionality using the `LogicManager.java` class which follows the `Logic` interface. Other components interact with a given component through its interface rather than the concrete class (reason: to prevent outside component's being coupled to the implementation of a component), as illustrated in the (partial) class diagram below.

<img src="images/ComponentManagers.png" width="300" />

The sections below give more details of each component.

### UI component

The **API** of this component is specified in [`Ui.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/application/ui/Ui.java)

![Structure of the UI Component](images/UiClassDiagram.png)

The UI consists of a `MainWindow` that is made up of parts e.g.`CommandBox`, `ResultDisplay`, `ApplicationListPanel`, `StatusBarFooter` etc. All these, including the `MainWindow`, inherit from the abstract `UiPart` class which captures the commonalities between classes that represent parts of the visible GUI.

The `UI` component uses the JavaFx UI framework. The layout of these UI parts are defined in matching `.fxml` files that are in the `src/main/resources/view` folder. For example, the layout of the [`MainWindow`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/application/ui/MainWindow.java) is specified in [`MainWindow.fxml`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/resources/view/MainWindow.fxml)

The `UI` component,

* executes user commands using the `Logic` component.
* listens for changes to `Model` data so that the UI can be updated with the modified data.
* keeps a reference to the `Logic` component, because the `UI` relies on the `Logic` to execute commands.
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component, as it displays `Application` object residing in the `Model`.

### Logic component

**API** : [`Logic.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/application/logic/Logic.java)

Here's a (partial) class diagram of the `Logic` component:

<img src="images/LogicClassDiagram.png" width="550"/>

How the `Logic` component works:
1. When `Logic` is called upon to execute a command, it uses the `ApplicationBookParser` class to parse the user command.
2. This results in a `Command` object (more precisely, an object of one of its subclasses e.g., `AddCommand`) which is executed by the `LogicManager`.
3. The command can communicate with the `Model` when it is executed (e.g. to add an application).
4. The result of the command execution is encapsulated as a `CommandResult` object which is returned back from `Logic`.

The Sequence Diagram below illustrates the interactions within the `Logic` component for the `execute("delete 1")` API call.

![Interactions Inside the Logic Component for the `delete 1` Command](images/DeleteSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> The lifeline for <code>DeleteCommandParser</code> should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.
</div>

Here are the other classes in `Logic` (omitted from the class diagram above) that are used for parsing a user command:

<img src="images/ParserClasses.png" width="600"/>

How the parsing works:
* When called upon to parse a user command, the `ApplicationBookParser` class creates an `XYZCommandParser` (`XYZ` is a placeholder for the specific command name e.g., `AddCommandParser`) which uses the other classes shown above to parse the user command and create a `XYZCommand` object (e.g., `AddCommand`) which the `ApplicationBookParser` returns back as a `Command` object.
* All `XYZCommandParser` classes (e.g., `AddCommandParser`, `DeleteCommandParser`, ...) inherit from the `Parser` interface so that they can be treated similarly where possible e.g, during testing.

### Model component
**API** : [`Model.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-3/tp/blob/master/src/main/java/seedu/application/model/Model.java)

<img src="images/ModelClassDiagram.png" width="500" />


The `Model` component,

* stores the application book data i.e., all `Application` objects (which are contained in a `UniqueApplicationList` object).
* stores the currently 'selected' `Application` objects (e.g., results of a search query) as a separate _filtered_ list.
* stores the filtered `Application` objects in another _sorted_ list that is sorted by one of several possible orders. This list is exposed to outsiders as an unmodifiable `ObservableList<Application>` that can be 'observed' e.g. the UI can be bound to this list so that the UI automatically updates when the data in the list changes. When the user selects the application index for an `EditCommand`, `DeleteCommand`, etc., this is the list that is referred to.
* stores a list of `Application` objects which have an existing `Interview` present in them. It is an `ObservableList<Application>` which is used to create the interview list in the UI.
* stores the `Application` objects which have an `Interview` within one week from the time the user is using the application as another _filtered_ list. This list is shown to the user in the remind window.
* stores a `UserPref` object that represents the userâ€™s preferences. This is exposed to the outside as a `ReadOnlyUserPref` objects.
* does not depend on any of the other three components (as the `Model` represents data entities of the domain, they should make sense on their own without depending on other components)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> An alternative (and arguably more OOP) model is given below. It has a <code>Tag</code> list in the <code>ApplicationBook</code>, which <code>Application</code> references. This allows <code>ApplicationBook</code> to only require one <code>Tag</code> object per unique tag, instead of each <code>Application</code> needing their own <code>Tag</code> objects. In addition, <code>Interview</code> is optional in each <code>Application</code>; thus, it is wrapped around with an <code>Optional</code> class to avoid the usage of <code>null</code>.<br>

<img src="images/ApplicationClassDiagram.png" width="600">

</div>


### Storage component

**API** : [`Storage.java`](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103-F14-3/tp/tree/master/src/main/java/seedu/application/storage/Storage.java)

<img src="images/StorageClassDiagram.png" width="550" />

The `Storage` component,
* can save both application book data and user preference data in json format, and read them back into corresponding objects.
* inherits from both `ApplicationBookStorage` and `UserPrefsStorage`, which means it can be treated as either one (if only the functionality of one is needed).
* depends on some classes in the `Model` component (because the `Storage` component's job is to save/retrieve objects that belong to the `Model`)

### Common classes

Classes used by multiple components are in the `seedu.application.commons` package.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## **Implementation**

This section describes some noteworthy details on how certain features are implemented.

### Undo/redo feature

#### Implementation

The undo/redo mechanism is facilitated by `VersionedApplicationBook`. It extends `ApplicationBook` with an undo/redo history, stored internally as an `applicationBookStateList` and `currentStatePointer`. Additionally, it implements the following operations:

* `VersionedApplicationBook#commit()`â€‰â€”â€‰Saves the current application book state in the history.
* `VersionedApplicationBook#undo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores the previous application book state from the history.
* `VersionedApplicationBook#redo()`â€‰â€”â€‰Restores a previously undone application book state from the history.

These operations are exposed in the `Model` interface as `Model#commitApplicationBook()`, `Model#undoApplicationBook()` and `Model#redoApplicationBook()` respectively.

Given below is an example usage scenario and how the undo/redo mechanism behaves at each step.

Step 1. The user launches the application for the first time. The `VersionedApplicationBook` will be initialized with the initial application book state, and the `currentStatePointer` pointing to that single application book state.

![UndoRedoState0](images/UndoRedoState0.png)

Step 2. The user executes `delete 5` command to delete the 5th application in the application book. The `delete` command calls `Model#commitApplicationBook()`, causing the modified state of the application book after the `delete 5` command executes to be saved in the `applicationBookStateList`, and the `currentStatePointer` is shifted to the newly inserted application book state.

![UndoRedoState1](images/UndoRedoState1.png)

Step 3. The user executes `add c/Google â€¦â€‹` to add a new application. The `add` command also calls `Model#commitApplicationBook()`, causing another modified application book state to be saved into the `applicationBookStateList`.

![UndoRedoState2](images/UndoRedoState2.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> If a command fails its execution, it will not call <code>Model#commitApplicationBook()</code>, so the application book state will not be saved into the <code>applicationBookStateList</code>.

</div>

Step 4. The user now decides that adding the application was a mistake, and decides to undo that action by executing the `undo` command. The `undo` command will call `Model#undoApplicationBook()`, which will shift the `currentStatePointer` once to the left, pointing it to the previous application book state, and restores the application book to that state.

![UndoRedoState3](images/UndoRedoState3.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: **Note:** If the `currentStatePointer` is at index 0, pointing to the initial ApplicationBook state, then there are no previous ApplicationBook states to restore. The `undo` command uses `Model#canUndoApplicationBook()` to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the undo.

</div>

The following sequence diagram shows how the undo operation works:

![UndoSequenceDiagram](images/UndoSequenceDiagram.png)

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> The lifeline for `UndoCommand` should end at the destroy marker (X) but due to a limitation of PlantUML, the lifeline reaches the end of diagram.

</div>

The `redo` command does the oppositeâ€‰â€”â€‰it calls `Model#redoApplicationBook()`, which shifts the `currentStatePointer` once to the right, pointing to the previously undone state, and restores the application book to that state.

<div markdown="span" class="alert alert-info">:information_source: <b>Note:</b> If the <code>currentStatePointer</code> is at index <code>applicationBookStateList.size() - 1</code>, pointing to the latest application book state, then there are no undone ApplicationBook states to restore. The <code>redo</code> command uses <code>Model#canRedoApplicationBook()</code> to check if this is the case. If so, it will return an error to the user rather than attempting to perform the redo.

</div>

Step 5. The user then decides to execute the command `list`. Commands that do not modify the application book, such as `list`, will not call `Model#commitApplicationBook()`, `Model#undoApplicationBook()` or `Model#redoApplicationBook()`. Thus, the `applicationBookStateList` remains unchanged.

![UndoRedoState4](images/UndoRedoState4.png)

Step 6. The user executes `clear`, which calls `Model#commitApplicationBook()`. Since the `currentStatePointer` is not pointing at the end of the `applicationBookStateList`, all application book states after the `currentStatePointer` will be purged. Reason: It no longer makes sense to redo the `add c/Google â€¦â€‹` command. This is the behavior that most modern desktop applications follow.

![UndoRedoState5](images/UndoRedoState5.png)

The following activity diagram summarizes what happens when a user executes a new command:

<img src="images/CommitActivityDiagram.png" width="250" />

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How undo & redo executes:**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Saves the entire application book.
  * Pros: Easy to implement.
  * Cons: May have performance issues in terms of memory usage.

* **Alternative 2:** Individual command knows how to undo/redo by
  itself.
  * Pros: Will use less memory (e.g. for `delete`, just save the application being deleted).
  * Cons: We must ensure that the implementation of each individual command are correct.

### Data archiving

#### Implementation

The purpose of this enhancement is to allow users to archive instead of deleting applications that are not applicable in the current time (e.g. applications that have been rejected/offered/no-response for a period of time).
* Data archiving of `Application` is done by adding a boolean attribute to the Application class as a record of its archive status.
* Two predicates in Model to adjust its `FilterList` shown to the user.
* By applying predicates to the `FilterList` in `ModelManager`, the archived `Application` can be hidden from the user.
* The list showing to the user in the UI is either showing the unarchived applications or the archived application using `ListCommand` and `ListArchiveCommand` respectively unless `FindCommand` is used.

The features of the new and modified commands are summarized as follows:
* `ArchiveCommand`: Set specified application archive status to `true` by utilising `ModelManager#archiveApplication`.
* `RetriveCommand`: Set specified application archive status to `false` by utilising `ModelManager#retrieveApplication`.
* `ListArchiveCommand`: Show the user the archived applications in CinternS.
* `ListCommand`: Show the user the unarchived applications in CinternS.

The following sequence diagram shows how the ModelManager works when archive command is executed to update the list shown in UI:

![ModelManagerUsingArchiveSequenceDiagram](images/ModelManagerUsingArchiveSequenceDiagram.png)

After`ApplicationBook#setArchive` is called the `Model#archiveApplication` will apply the predicate that hides the archived application to the `FilterList` in `Model` and the archived application will be hidden from the updated list shown in UI.

#### Constraints of Data archiving
Archived applications cannot be archived again. Doing so will cause `CommandException` to be thrown. The same reasoning applies to retrieve command.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How should data archiving be implemented?**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Add a boolean attribute to Application class.
    - Pros: Concise implementation as only predicates and a few new commands are added to make it work.
    - Cons: Current tests need to be modified.
- **Alternative 2:** Adding archived application to a list similar to UniqueApplicationList as record.
    - Pros: Less effort to maintain the previous test case as this implementation makes only minor modification on previous classes.
    - Cons: Too much duplication and maintenance of actual code (Another copy of UniqueList need to be created and maintained).

**Aspect: Should the user be allowed to edit archived application directly?**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** User are allowed to edit archived application
    - Pros: A more convenient usage for the user.
    - Cons: Less "hidden" nature of archiving data.
- **Alternative 2:** User are not allow to edit archived application
    - Pros: Usage of archive is more intuitive as archive applications are only used for future references.
    - Cons: Inconvenient usage as the user need to retrieve archived application before editing it.
- Alternative 1 is chosen in this case by referencing Whatsapp archived chat where the user can still send message (make modification) in the archived chat.

### Interview Feature

#### Implementation

The `Interview` feature acts as one of the fields under `Application`. `Interview` itself contains four different compulsory fields in order to let Interview exist, which are `Round`, `InterviewDate`, `InterviewTime` and `Location`.

The class diagram is as follows:
![ApplicationClassDiagram](images/ApplicationClassDiagram.png)

Since an `Application` can have either zero or one `Interview`, hence `Interview` is wrapped with `Optional` class, with `Optional.empty()` assigned to the `Interview` field if the `Application` does not have an interview yet.

New commands are added to facilitate the operations of `Interview`.
- `AddInterviewCommand` : Utilising `ApplicationBook#setApplication()` to assign new `Interview` to `Application`.
- `DeleteInterviewCommand` : Utilising `ApplicationBook#setApplication()` to reset `Interview` to empty in an `Application`.

1. The user enters `interview 2 ir/Technical interview id/2022-10-12 it/1400 il/Zoom` to assign a new Interview to the Application at index 2 in the application list. The execution prompts the `LogicManager` to call the `ApplicationBookParser#parseCommand(String)` method.
2. The ApplicationBookParser then identifies the corresponding `AddInterviewCommandParser` to create. Then, the corresponding interview sub-fields are used to instantiate new `Interview`, which in turn is used to create new `AddInterviewCommand`.
3. The LogicManager executes the returned `AddInterviewCommand` object. In here, the target application is retrieved from the `ApplicationBook` to create another new `Application` with the corresponding `Interview`.
4. Now, we replace the old `Application` object with the newly created `Application` object. But before that, the `ApplicationBook#setApplication()` goes through checks to ensure the `ApplicationBook` does not contain duplicated `Interview`. (The meaning of `duplicated Interview` is discussed in the **Constraints of Interview** section below.)
5. Once the check is passed, the `ApplicationBook` successfully replaces the old `Application` object, hence it now contains the updated `Application` object with `Interview`.
6. The `DeleteInterview` operation with command `remove-i 3` has a similar implementation as the `AddInterview` operation, but a new `Application` object with empty `Interview` is used to replace the old `Application` object instead.

The sequence diagram is as follows:
![AddInterviewSequenceDiagram](images/AddInterviewSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Constraints of Interview

In order for the Interview fields to make sense, several constraints are added:
1. `InterviewDate` must be after the `Application` applied `Date`, else `InvalidInterviewException` will be thrown.
2. `Interview` duration is set to be one hour long for each `Interview`.
3. Two Interviews are considered duplicates if they have the same `InterviewDate` and overlapping `InterviewTime`, then `DuplicateInterviewException` will be thrown.
4. New `Interview` is allowed to overwrite the current `Interview` that is already assigned to an `Application`. This can be considered as an `EditInterview` feature, but we did not explicitly write out this feature as the `AddInterviewCommand` can be reused here instead.

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: How should Interview be presented?**

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Interview exists as one of the fields under Application.
  - Pros: Easy to implement, represent the real world OOP model.
  - Cons: Current tests need to be modified.
- **Alternative 2:** Interview exists as another separate list, stored under another new list, called `InterviewBook`.
  - Pros: Tests do not need to be modified, only new tests need to be added.
  - Cons: Too much duplication of code (Another copy of ApplicationBook).

### Find Feature 

#### Design considerations

**Aspect: What fields should the `find` command search through?** 

- **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `find` command finds all applications whose company name and/or position contain any of the specified keywords.
  - Pros: Aligns with the definition of duplicate application, where applications are uniquely identified by their company name AND position. 
  - Cons: Tests need to be modified to take into consideration finding by more than 1 field.
- **Alternative 2:** `find` command finds only all applications whose company name contain any of the specified keywords.
  - Pros: Easy to implement, with minimal modification to existing tests.
  - Cons: Limited breadth of search, does not align with definition of unique application. 

### Sort Feature

#### Implementation

The sort feature allows the user to sort the application list using company names, positions, application dates or interview dates. Each of these orders can also be reversed.

The class diagram below shows the classes in the Logic component relevant for sorting:

![SortClassDiagram](images/SortClassDiagram.png)

There is an abstract `SortCommand` class that inherits from the abstract `Command` class. Then, there is a concrete `SortCommand` subclass for each possible order of sort. Meanwhile, there is a single `SortCommandParser` class. When it parses the arguments supplied to a `sort` command, it decides which of the `SortCommand` subclasses to instantiate.

The following sequence diagram shows the parsing of a sort command from the user featuring just two of the possible orders - by company and by date:

![SortParserSequenceDiagram](images/SortParserSequenceDiagram.png)

When calling the `parse` method of the `SortCommandParser`, the argument provided for the `o/` prefix determines which subclass of `SortCommand` will get created. In the event that the prefix is not provided, a `SortByDateCommand` is returned by default.

The next sequence diagram shows the execution of the created SortCommand, again featuring just two of the possible orders:

![SortCommandSequenceDiagram](images/SortCommandSequenceDiagram.png)

When `LogicManager` `executes` the `SortCommand` created, the `SortCommand` will call one of the `sortApplicationList` methods provided by the `Model` interface for sorting the application list. Internally, the `Model` wraps its `ObservableList` of `Applications` inside a `SortedList`, so all it has to do is to set an appropriate comparator on the `SortedList` to attain the desired sort order.

A user may have a sort order that works best for them that they would consistently want to use over the others. To make the experience more convenient for the user, CinternS stores the last used sort order on the hard disk so that it can sort the applications list in that order the next time the app is reopened. This way the user does not need to re-enter the same sort command every session.

The current sort order is represented using a `SortSetting` enum, which can be one of the 4x2 possible sort orders. This `SortSetting` is stored in the `UserPrefs` object together with the other user preferences like screen size. The sort order is then stored inside the `preferences.json` file to be read the next time the app is opened.

The following sequence diagram shows the process of initialising the sort order of a `ModelManager` as it is being instantiated:

![SortInitialisationSequenceDiagram](images/SortInitialisationSequenceDiagram.png)

The `MainApp` passes the application book data and the `userPrefs` retrieved from storage to the constructor for `ModelManager`. The `ModelManager` creates a copy of the `userPrefs` object. Then, the `sortSetting` is retrieved and used to decide how the ModelManager should sort the applications. The diagram above shows just two of the possible sort orders and the resulting method calls.

#### Constraints of Sort Feature

The user can only sort based on one field at a time.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: What method(s) to add to the `Model` interface?**

* **Alternative 1:** Add a single `sortApplicationList` method that takes in a boolean `shouldReverse` and an enum value `order` that specifies what order to use for sorting.
    * Pros: Only one method is required. Potentially prevents duplication of similar code.
    * Cons: Implementation of the method can become long and complex if many more possible sort orders are added in the future, especially if each sort order's implementation turn out not to be similar.

* **Alternative 2 (current choice):** Add separate methods for every sort order, each only taking a boolean `shouldReverse` as argument
    * Pros: Avoids the need for switch statements to control the behaviour. Implementation of forward and reversed orders likely similar, so code can be shared.
    * Cons: `Model` interface may have many sort methods if many possible orders are added later.

* **Alternative 3:** Have 2 methods for each order, one for forward order and one for reverse order.
    * Pros: Removes the need for any flag argument.
    * Cons: Leads to a lot of code duplication since implementing a reversed sort is likely very similar to implementing the original sort in most if not all cases. Also creates a lot more methods.

**Aspect: How to allow the `SortCommand` to sort using different possible orders when executed?**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Create separate subclasses of `SortCommand` each for sorting based on a different order.
    * Pros: Better follows the Open-Closed Principle since none of the current `SortCommand` subclasses need to be edited when a new sort order is implemented.
    * Cons: Multiple classes associated with a single command word.

* **Alternative 2:** Store an enum value inside each `SortCommand` instance indicating what order to use for sorting. Then, in the `execute` method, use a switch statement to make the appropriate function calls on the `Model`.
    * Pros: Will avoid the need for creating multiple classes.
    * Cons: Seems redundant to use another switch statement for controlling the `SortCommand` behaviour after already using one in `SortCommandParser` for determining the order to use.


### Remind Feature

#### Implementation
The `remind` feature allows the user to view a list of upcoming interviews within the next 1 week, sorted by interview date and time.

The rationale for this enhancement is that the interview list on the main GUI window shows all non-archived interviews, including interviews that have passed and interviews scheduled weeks to months later. This feature enables a focused view of only approaching interviews within the next week.

The sequence diagram below shows the crucial components involved in executing the `remind` command:

![Remind Sequence Diagram](images/RemindSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How should the `remind` feature be presented?**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Upcoming interviews presented in a pop-up window upon `remind` command input by the user.
    * Pros: Behaviour lines up better with the rest of CinternS where changes to the display are driven by commands. Better code testability. 
    * Cons: Users are not reminded of upcoming interviews if they do not enter the `remind` command.

* **Alternative 2:** Pop-up window appears alongside main GUI window upon starting up the application.
    * Pros: Better aligns with the purpose of a reminder as a prompt to the user without the user having to input any commands.
    * Cons: Could complicate the UI design of the application with the use of more than one primary stage or scene in JavaFX.

**Aspect: How should the remind command filter out upcoming interviews?**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** By using an `UpcomingInterviewPredicate`.
    * Pros: Better aligns with the Separation of Concerns principle where the definition of an 'upcoming' interview in terms of time is contained within the predicate.
    * Cons: Increased coupling between RemindCommand in Logic and a separate predicate class in Model.

* **Alternative 2:** By maintaining a list of upcoming interviews in the ModelManager.
    * Pros: Reduced coupling between different classes.
    * Cons: Each time an action is performed on an application or interview (such as archiving, adding or editing), the list of upcoming interviews has to be informed and updated as well. 

### Statistic Feature

#### Implementation
The statistic feature is a simple feature that allows the user to obtain a summarized statistics of the whole application list.

The summary statistics are shown on the UI using the `ResultDisplay` section. The sequence diagram below shows the workflow of the statistic feature. It gets the list of applications from the model and tabulates the respective information. The tabulation result is then output through `CommandResult`.

![Statistic Sequence Diagram](images/StatisticSequenceDiagram.png)


#### Constraints of Statistic Feature
The statistics of the applications will only show when the user enter `stats` command. A possible future improvement is to reorganise the UI section to display real-time statistics in one section and the list view of applications and interviews are in another section.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How should the statistic feature be presented?**

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** Utilise `ResultDisplay` section in UI to show the user the statistics.
    * Pros: Does not need extra space in the UI to show the statistics, and simpler and more straightforward implementation.
    * Cons: Increase coupling between `ModelManager` and `StatsCommand` as it requires the list of applications in `ModelManager`.

* **Alternative 2:** Create a new section in UI to show the user real-time statistics.
    * Pros: Does not increase coupling between classes and align with the implementation of Applications and Interviews list views.
    * Cons: Space usage for UI might be inefficient as the user will not always want to review the statistics of the applications.

- Alternative 1 is chosen as our team justified that the implementation is simpler, and is less likely to contain bugs despite the accessing application list from `ModelManager`. Furthermore, interview and application lists are more important to be shown on the GUI when compared to the statistics.

### Status Feature

#### Implementation
The `Status` feature allows the user to add a status to a new application and edit the status of their existing application as they progress through the application process.

![StatusClassDiagram](images/StatusClassDiagram.png)

#### Constraints of the Status Feature
In order to provide better visualisation of `Status` with added colours and easy integration with the Statistic feature, only some fixed values of `Status` can be allowed. As such, users are not able to add any other statuses.

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: How should the `Status` feature be implemented?** 

* **Alternative 1 (current choice):** `Status` is implemented as an enum.
    * Pros: Allows the Statistic feature to easily provide a summary of current applications with application progress already added as status. Can be displayed easily with different colors based on the statuses as the status values are fixed.
    * Cons: More restrictive for the users as only a few statuses are allowed (i.e. no custom statuses).

* **Alternative 2:** `Status` is implemented as a normal class.
    * Pros: Gives more freedom to the users to add statuses that they want.
    * Cons: Logically `Status` will become the same as `Tag`, which undermines the purpose of `Status`.

### [Proposed] Find Interview Feature

#### Implementation
1. The user enters `find-i technical interview` to filter the existing interviews with keyword `technical interview` in one of the interview fields, e.g. `Round`. The execution prompts the `LogicManager` to call the `ApplicationBookParser#parseCommand(String)` method.
2. The ApplicationBookParser then identifies the corresponding `FindInterviewCommandParser` to create. Then, the keywords entered are used to instantiate new `Predicates` which in turn is to be used to construct new `FindInterviewCommand`.
3. The LogicManager executes the returned `FindInterviewCommand` object. In here, the `FindInterviewCommand` calls the `updateFilteredApplicationList()` to set the predicates to the `FilteredList<Application>`.
4. Now, the `FilteredList<Application>` is ready to be observed by the observers to display the filtered interviews onto the UI.

The sequence diagram below shows the crucial components involved in the find interview feature.
![FindInterviewSequenceDiagram](images/FindInterviewSequenceDiagram.png)

#### Design Considerations

**Aspect: Should `find` and `find-i` be combined?**

* **Alternative 1 (proposed choice):** No, they should be separated.
     * Pros: Adhere to Single Responsibility Principle as `find` command should only be responsible to search for application list.
     * Cons: Increases LoC while the majority of the codes are similar.
* **Alternative 2:** Yes, they should be combined.
     * Pros: Reduces code duplication by just parsing a new prefix into `find` command e.g. `i/` to indicate for finding under interview list.
     * Cons: Violates Single Responsibility Principle.

### Product scope

**Target user profile**:

* Computing students
* Need to manage many internship applications
* Prefer desktop apps over other types
* Fast typist
* Prefer typing to mouse interactions
* Comfortable using CLI apps

**Value proposition**:

Internship applications can stretch over a long period of time, making it hard to keep track of the states of each one. This product will help students keep track of multiple internship application processes more systematically.

      Situation 2: First application is an unarchived application.<br>
      Expected   : No application is retrieved. Error details are shown.

   3. Test case: `archive 1`<br>
      Situation 1: First application is an archived application.<br>
      Expected   : No application is retrieved. Error details are shown.<br>
      Situation 2: First application is an unarchived application.<br>
      Expected   : First application is archived from the list. Details of the archived application are shown. The list remains as the filtered list by the keyword.

## **Appendix: Effort**

CinternS was for many of us the first group-based software development project we have done. A significant amount of effort was spent on understanding the existing codebase, gaining more familiarity with technologies like Git and JavaFX and also learning to coordinate with one another.

At the start of the project, the first significant challenge we faced was editing the codebase to work using internship applications instead of persons. Since almost everything in the codebase was dependent on the `Person` model, a lot of the codebase needed to be edited. Splitting of the work was a challenge because only changing a portion of the codebase would not allow the product to function. Eventually, we did manage to migrate everything over within the first increment 1.2 of the project.

After increment 1.2, we started to implement more features unique to our internship application tracking app. The original address book app (AB3) that CinternS was built from had `Persons` as the only main entity in the `Model`. In CinternS, we replaced `Persons` with `Applications` and we also have `Interviews` associated with each `Application`. We had to study the code from AB3 to understand how the Model works with other components in the program so that we can correctly implement the `Application` and `Interview` entities. We also spent more effort in ensuring the two models integrate with each other correctly. In particular, with `Interview` as one of the fields under `Application`, storing and extracting `Interview` into and from the JSON file required a better understanding of the data interchange format.

Along with the two models we also implemented new commands that work with interviews like `remove-i` and `remind`. The additional model made coding and testing significantly more difficult since more classes needed to be added. Many bugs were encountered during the development of CinternS due to clashes between the existing features of AB3 and the newly-added features. Significant effort was also invested in modifying the GUI to ensure the features worked together seamlessly.

A key challenge our team encountered was that there were tasks that were highly interdependent. For instance, we had to wait for the model for internship `applications` to be implemented before the rest of us could contribute to the refactoring of the AB3 codebase to suit internship applications. Some features such as `sort` and `remind` also only made sense after the implementation for `interview` was completed. As such, time management was critical in order to meet internal deadlines, and each of us in the team held ourselves to high standards in this regard to ensure we gave each other sufficient time to deliver our increments.

Another major challenge we faced was with the GUI. Apart from getting the backend to work seamlessly, we had to resolve bugs in the frontend hindering users from fully enjoying the app. Now that we had two different types of entities to display, we had to rework the interface to display both types of information. We had to take care in ensuring the data being displayed remained synchronised with each other and with the data in the model. For instance, we encountered a bug that caused the `remind` feature to display incorrect data due to the underlying list not being updated correctly. Resolving it took some greater appreciation of the Observer design pattern. We also had to spend extra effort working with JavaFX to adjust some of the components in the GUI and ensure the data is displayed without error. To top everything off, we designed a new GUI that looked neat and intuitive and gave it a new theme colour using CSS to make it stand out from the original version of AB3.
