This section shares with you on how to use each [[ command ]] in detail.

Before continuing, ensure you have read the section on [Flags](#flags) and [Placeholders](#placeholders).

What you should expect to find:

* A description of the command
* The format of the command
* The expected behaviour of the command
* A few valid and invalid examples of the command
* Important points to note

```note
* For each command, "Format" indicates the syntax of the command.
* Square brackets indicates an optional [[ parameter ]].
* In most commands, if the same parameter is repeated and only one is required, we take the last value provided.
