This section covers how to use each command in detail.
Before continuing, ensure you have read the section on [Flags](#flags) and [Placeholders](#placeholders).

What you should expect to find:

* A description of the command
* The format of the command
* The expected behaviour of the command
* A few valid and invalid examples of the command
* Important points to note

**Note:**

* For each command, "Format" indicates the syntax of the command.
* Square brackets indicates an optional parameter.
* In most commands, if the same parameter is repeated and only one is required, we take the last value provided.
