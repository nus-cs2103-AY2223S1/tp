A command consists of:

1. Command Word: Tells FoodRem what action you wish to execute. These actions are covered in [Commands](#commands).
1. [Flags](#flags): Distinguishes between inputs. A flag is usually followed by a placeholder.
1. [Placeholders](#placeholders): Represents data that you wish to input. Replace this with valid data. For example, `ITEM_NAME` in `n/ITEM_NAME` can be replaced with `n/Potato`.
