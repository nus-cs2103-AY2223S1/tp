If you haven't installed FoodRem, simply follow these steps to set it up:

1. Download and install [Java 11](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html) on your computer
1. Download the latest `foodrem.jar` file from our [releases page](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/releases/latest)
1. Copy the jar file to an empty folder. This will be your home folder for FoodRem
1. Double-click on the jar file to launch FoodRem

```warning
Remember to add `foodrem.jar` into an empty folder as additional data and configuration files will be created when launching FoodRem for the first time!
```

Congratulations! You now have FoodRem set up.

```danger
When you launch FoodRem, notice that you will have a folder called "data" that is created in the same folder as `foodrem.jar`. Editing the file might corrupt your data, avoid doing this unless you know what you are doing!
```
