### Installation

If you haven't installed FoodRem, simply follow these steps to set it up:

1. Ensure you have [Java 11](https://docs.oracle.com/en/java/javase/11/install/overview-jdk-installation.html) installed on your computer.
1. Download the latest `foodrem.jar` file from our [release page](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-W16-2/tp/releases/)
1. Copy the jar file to an empty folder. This will be your home folder for FoodRem.
1. Double-click on the jar file to launch FoodRem.

```note 
If FoodRem does not launch after double-clicking the jar file, check out the [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) section for an alternative solution.
```

Congratulations! You now have FoodRem set up.
