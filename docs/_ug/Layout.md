When you launch FoodRem, FoodRem appears on your screen as a [[ graphical-user-interface:Graphical User Interface ]], or GUI. Let's look at the layout of the different components of FoodRem.

FoodRem's GUI consists of a single main window, as well as the [[ help-window:Help Window ]]. The main window consists of three components:

1. Command Input Box
1. Item List Box
1. Command Output Box

The following picture of the main window shows the three components, numbered accordingly:

Besides the main window, FoodRem also has the Help Window. It is not part of the main GUI and is only shown after a [Help Command](#receive-help-during-usage-help) is run.

The Help Window looks like the following:
