/**
 * A list of deliverers that enforces uniqueness between its elements and does not allow nulls.
 * A deliverer is considered unique by comparing using {@code Deliverer#isSameDeliverer(Deliverer)}.
 * As such, adding and updating of deliverers uses Deliverer#isSameDeliverer(Deliverer) for equality to ensure that
 * the deliverer being added or updated is unique in terms of identity in the UniqueDelivererList.
 * However, the removal of a deliverer uses Deliverer#equals(Object) to ensure that the deliverer with exactly the
 * same fields will be removed.
 *
 * Supports a minimal set of list operations.
