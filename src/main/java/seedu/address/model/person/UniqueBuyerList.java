 * A list of buyers that enforces uniqueness between its elements and does not allow nulls.
 * A buyer is considered unique by comparing using {@code Buyer#isSameBuyer(Buyer)}.
 * As such, adding and updating of buyers uses Buyer#isSameBuyer(Buyer) for equality to ensure that the buyer
 * being added or updated is unique in terms of identity in the UniqueBuyerList.
 * However, the removal of a buyer uses Buyer#equals(Object) to ensure that the buyer with exactly the same fields
 * will be removed.
 *
 * Supports a minimal set of list operations.
