# FABook

Figure: A mockup of our application

FABook is a **desktop app for managing contacts, optimized for a financial adviser to use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). 
If you can type fast, FABook can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

**FABook** is a dependable assistant for financial advisors by **reminding** them of meetings and consolidating **crucial information** like financial plans and client information right at their fingertips! <br>

Financial advisers now focus on giving their full attention to their clients without having to worry about things slipping their mind.

**FABook** is optimized for a **one-stop storage solution** to store and remind them on
**everything** they need to know about their client.

## Example usages:
  * Contact book for storing client contacts.
  * Meeting and scheduling reminder.
