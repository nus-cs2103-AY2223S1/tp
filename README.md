* This is **a brownfield project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Can be used by secretaries and treasurers to manage the club they belong to.
  * Can also be used to take notes and as a bare-boned address book as well.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _SectresBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `SectresBook` because it is used by Secretaries and Treasurers of clubs to manage their club information.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SectresBook Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w12-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
