* Teacher's Assistance Book (TAB) is **a desktop app made for professors or teaching assistants for managing contacts**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as a contact book, storing contacts
  * as a storage to store other relevant details of contacts (e.g a student's exam results)
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _TAB_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `Teacher's Assistance Book` (`TAB` for short) because it was created to facilitate teaching assistants' and professors' when managing their students, and even managing teaching assistants (for professors) too.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see **[TAB's Website](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T17-1/tp)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org#https://se-education.org/#contributing) for more info.
