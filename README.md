# JeeqTracker

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

## Description

**JeeqTracker is a desktop application created for home-based business owners / resellers that helps them manage the clients
that they interact with by keeping track of their `BUY / SELL` transactions, and `REMARKS` of clients.**
While it has a GUI (Graphical User Interface), most of the user interactions happen using a CLI (Command Line Interface).

[Download](https://github.com/AY2223S1-CS2103T-T09-1/tp/releases) our application now!

## Motivation
- Current existing applications are mostly GUI centric, which is slower to get things done compared to CLI.
- Existing applications such as Microsoft Excel is difficult to use, as it involves too many functionalities (some of which are not useful for them), and does not have a very clean interface.
- By creating a CLI centric application, with useful functionalities such as `filter` by transactions, `sort` by date, and a `total` profit in the GUI that updates for particular clients or in total, proves beneficial to home-based business owners / resellers.
