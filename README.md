# Plannit

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

* **Plannit** is an **all-in-one application** that streamlines the execution of module
  deliverables by **empowering NUS students** with the ability to manage **tasks**, **links** and 
  **module-mates** (i.e., students in the same module) to increase their productivity.

* Plannit will be the **go-to platform** for them to access all modules links and information without needing to tediously navigate through multiple websites.

* Plannit can be used to track their tasks for each module so that they do not have to worry about unintentionally forgetting their tasks.

* Plannit allows tracking of student contacts by module. Students do not have to worry about forgetting which friend takes which module and can thus easily know who to approach when in need of help.

* Plannit is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Plannit can help you track your module information and tasks faster than traditional GUI apps!

## Usage

* Categorize module information by modules for easier tracking!
