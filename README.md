# About

CodeConnect aims to help busy students manage their tasks, while facilitating collaboration between students.
By integrating one's contacts and task list, CodeConnect provides convenient features such as searching for contacts that are able to help with a particular task in your task list, through a simple command line interface.

Of course, CodeConnect is able to perform sorting and filtering functions on your contacts/tasks.

With CodeConnect, the friction between getting stuck on an assignment and reaching out for help will be reduced, allowing you to focus on what really matters.

## Main Features

* Keep track of your tasks, their deadlines, and the modules they belong to
  * Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
  * Sort tasks by deadline
* Manage your contacts and keep track of the modules they are taking
  * Search for contacts taking a specified module
  * Search for contacts that can help with your specified task
