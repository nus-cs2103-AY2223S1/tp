Coydir is a desktop application used by Human Resource Executives to manage their employee base and streamline data collection. It is made simpler with a easy-to-use graphical user interface(GUI) and can also be accessed through your Command Line Interface(CLI)

- It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
- It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
- It is named Coydir as Coy is short for company and dir is short for directory
- For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Coydir Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t15-1.github.io/tp/)**.
