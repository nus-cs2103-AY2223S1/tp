* This is **InternConnect**, an application to access applicants' data for university recruiters.<br>
  Example usages:
  * as an application to store applicants' job application detail
  * as an application to find applicants that applied for the same role
* The project is built on a sample software project for a desktop application (called _AddressBook_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[InternConnect Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103-f14-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
