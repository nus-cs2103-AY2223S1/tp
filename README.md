# :memo: CLInkedIn

CLInkedIn is a desktop contact management Java application made for Recruiters to manage their contacts list of candidates.
CLInkedIn operates mainly using a Command Line Interface (CLI), but still has a Graphical User Interface (GUI) made with JavaFX for improved user experience.

If you can type fast, CLInkedIn can get your contact management tasks done faster than
traditional GUI apps.
