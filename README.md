* **Tuthub** is a desktop app for tech-savvy tuition agents who want to keep track of hundreds of tutorsâ€™ profiles in a more organised and systematic way compared to excel sheets, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Tuthub Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t15-3.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
