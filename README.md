`CLIMods` is a native desktop application for NUS students to explore, manage and plan academic
modules that they are interested in taking. It is primarily optimised for the use via a Command Line
Interface (CLI) while still providing the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Power users
of the command line/terminal will be able to plan and manage their modules much faster than doing it
on [nusmods.com](https://nusmods.com).

> This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
