# SoConnect 
SoConnect is a desktop app for NUS SoC students to manage their contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SoConnect can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps!🚀✨

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SoConnect Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w15-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
