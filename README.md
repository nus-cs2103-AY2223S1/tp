## Overview

Are you

- a university student leading software engineering teams in your modules?

- desperate for a single source of truth on who’s doing what and by when?

Then, **TruthTable** is _perfect_ for you.

   Docs)
2. visualise your teams’ progress easily
3. delegate tasks to your team members conveniently
4. use CLI interface to manage your project tasks _blazingly_ fast.
