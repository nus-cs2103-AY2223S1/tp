* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* **`Financial Advisor Planner` (`FAP` for short)** is a desktop application targetted at Financial Advisors. Financial Advisors often have many potential and current clients to keep track of. Our product will provide an easy way to store, manage, search and view clients information to help Financial Advisors in managing their clients and appoitments.

  Example usages:
  * As a financial advisor, you can keep track of your clients
  * As a financial advisor, you can view your appointments and schedule for the day
  * As a financial advisor, you can store important information such as client's risk appetites and yearly salary
* The project simulates an ongoing **brownfield software project** for a desktop application used to managing client information by Financial Advisors.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  * It is developed by a team of 5 from NUS Computing, you can find out more about us **[here](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w09-2.github.io/tp/AboutUs.html)**.

* It is named `Financial Advisor Planner`  because it allows financial advisors to plan their schedule and appointments with clients
