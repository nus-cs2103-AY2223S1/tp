# Please Hire Us
Are you a CS student struggling to keep track of your internship?
Do you feel tired of using spreadsheets to keep track of your applications?
We have just the right tool for you!

Introducing PleaseHireUs (PHU), the internship tracking application made just for you!

Here are its main features:
* View the status of your individual application and assessment dates at a glance
* View the overall statistics of the status of all your internship applications in a stacked bar chart

Now you will never miss any internship application deadlines or interviews again!
PleaseHireUs has been optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, PleaseHireUs can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
We hope you find PleaseHireUs to be very useful in your internship hunt!
