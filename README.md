# Cobb - Property Address Book
Cobb is an optimised object-oriented command-line entry management application that aims to make database management for Real Estate Agents easier and more accessible.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application used for managing contact details and property information.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Cobb Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-f12-1.github.io/tp/)**.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
