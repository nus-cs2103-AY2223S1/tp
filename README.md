BookFace replaces a paper-based system or manual tracking of books, providing greater speed/efficiency in identifying where a book is, or when it is due. It also adds a member-tracking system to handle an increasing number of library members.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
