* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students module code CS2103T**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Friendnancial_) used for managing contact details for Financial Advisors.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC).
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.

* It is named `Friendnancial` (`Friend` for short) because the application aims to be your friend in the financial space.
* Financial advisors (FA) have many different types of contacts: warm clients, cold clients, normal friends. FAs have to regularly keep up with their contacts, by **wishing them happy birthday**, or **sending invites** and **following up** with contacts, they may do so on multiple platforms such as LinkedIn, Instagram, email. FAs have to **store information about their clients such as contracts and schemes/packages**.
