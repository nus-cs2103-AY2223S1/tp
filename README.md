* This is an **address log application for medical staff**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * for medical administrators to lookup patient details and forward them to the relevant attending nurses or physicians
  * for medical administrators to keep track of which nurses are assigned to which patients
  * for medical administrators to label patients with specific conditions so precautions can be taken by attending staff if needed
* As most commands are inputed with the keyboard, it is best suited for a medical administrator who is familiar with CLI Applications.
* However, due to its intuitive design, beginners can expect to pick it up very quickly.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Healthcare Xpress Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103-f13-4.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
