# bobaBot
* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application _designed for bubble tea cashiers_ to manage customersâ€™ membership details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `bobaBot` because it tracks the membership details of bubble tea customers.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[bobaBot Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w09-1.github.io/tp/)**.
