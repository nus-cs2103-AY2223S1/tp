* Teacher’s Pet is a desktop application for managing contacts of students and classes, optimised for use via a Command
Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Teacher’s
Pet can get your contact and class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
* It is named `Teacher's Pet` (`TP` for short) because it was designed to assist teachers.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Teacher's Pet Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t09-4.github.io/tp/)**.
