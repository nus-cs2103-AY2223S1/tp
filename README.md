# FRIDAY
FRIDAY is a one easy-to-access desktop app for you to track your student's progress, optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast,
FRIDAY can get your student's progress management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps !
