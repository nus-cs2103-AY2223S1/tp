# Plannit

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

* **Plannit** is an **all-in-one application** that streamlines the execution of module
  deliverables by **empowering NUS students** with the ability to manage **tasks**, **links** and 
  **module-mates** (i.e., students in the same module) to increase their productivity.

* Plannit will be the **go-to platform** for them to access all modules links and information without needing to tediously navigate through multiple websites.

* Plannit allows tracking of student contacts by module. Students do not have to worry about forgetting which friend takes which module.

* Plannit is **optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI)** while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Plannit can help you track your module information and tasks faster than traditional GUI apps!

## Usage

* Categorize module information by modules for easier tracking!
