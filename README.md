## About the project

* HobbyList is a **desktop app for managing hobby activities, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, HobbyList can get your activity management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[HobbyList Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t12-3.github.io/tp/)**.
