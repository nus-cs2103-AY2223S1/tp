### NUSConnect

* ConnectNUS is a desktop address book application used for NUS CS students to keep track of their own modules, and their friend's modules and contacts as well. This is to facilitate NUS CS students to keep track of their friends to work with so that they can easily find friends to collaborate with.
* It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
