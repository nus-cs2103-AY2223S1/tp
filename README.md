# OmniHealth
OmniHealth is a **desktop app for private clinic practitioners to quickly store, edit and search for patients and their records**. It is optimised for use via a **Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

If you can type fast, OmniHealth can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps! ðŸ’Šâœ¨
