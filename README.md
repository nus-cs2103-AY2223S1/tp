* This is **a desktop application project for tuition centers**. </br>
Example usages:

  * as a tutor and class management tool

* The project aims to provide tuition centers with a desktop application (called _myStudent_) to manage admin matters.

  * It allows **management of the classes and tutors**. For example, it comes with tutor assignment and student allocation capabilities.
  * It provides **tracking of student performance and fee payment status**.

* It is named `myStudent` because it is created for admin staff to manage the center's own students.
