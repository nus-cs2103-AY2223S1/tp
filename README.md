* This is a **brownfield team project** done by Software Engineering (SE) students.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _SoConnect_) used for managing contact details of peers in NUS School of Computing.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[SoConnect Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w08-3.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org/).
