# TrackO

TrackO is a desktop application that helps you manage your business orders and inventory, optimized for use via a
Command Line Interface (CLI), while still having the benefits of a visually appealing Graphical User Interface (GUI).
If you can type fast, TrackO can help you manage your order and inventory tracking faster than traditional GUI
applications!
