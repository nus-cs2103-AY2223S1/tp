* Gim is a **desktop app for managing gym exercises, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface** (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, Gim allows you to keep track your exercises and Personal Records in a efficient way.
  Example usages:
  * as a tracking tool to keep track of completed exercises
  * as a tracking tool to keep track of your personal records
  * as a workout generator to generate exercises based on your personal records
* It is named `Gim` as a name-play tribute to `Vim` and `Gym`.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Gim Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t15-4.github.io/tp/)**.
