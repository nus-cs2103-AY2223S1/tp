FoodWhere (FW) is a desktop app for managing food reviews, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). FW can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps if you can type fast.<br>

**Example usages:**
  * add food stalls
  * add reviews for food stalls
  * list all food stalls stored in FoodWhere
  * list all reviews stored in FoodWhere
  * edit existing food stalls in FoodWhere
  * edit existing reviews in FoodWhere
  * find food stalls by name and/or tag
  * find reviews by stall name and/or tag
  * sort food stalls by name
  * sort reviews by stall name, date or ratings
