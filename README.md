# TABS
* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application designed for *project team leaders* used for assigning tasks and groups.

With TABs, project team leaders can:
* view information of which group members are in their project.
* track which tasks have been assigned to which members.
* see an estimate of how much workload each member has.
* receive information regarding upcoming deadlines.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TABS Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w10-1.github.io/tp/)**.
