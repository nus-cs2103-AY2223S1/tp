# MyInsuRec
*MyInsuRec* is a desktop app for financial advisors to manage and organize their clients and meetings, helping
financial advisors stay connected with their clients. *MyInsuRec* is best suited for the quick typist, as it is
optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI), with all the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _MyInsuRec_) used for managing clients' details and meetings for an insurance agent.
* It is named `MyInsuRec` because it helps financial advisors to keep track of their clients and meetings.
