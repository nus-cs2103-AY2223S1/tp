#EZLead
* This is **a project for Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
  Example usages:
  * As a tech lead, you can edit the team information and team members in the team
  * As a tech lead, you can assign tasks to each team. 
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application used for managing teams in a work place by tech leads.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `EZLead` because it makes the life of tech leads easier to manage the many tasks within the company.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[EZLead Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-w09-3.github.io/tp/)**.
