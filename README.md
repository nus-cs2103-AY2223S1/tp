* This is a **brownfield project** completed by Team CS2103T-F11-2.</br>
  Example usages:
  * Used by NUS students who want to track the progress of assignments and tasks completed for the module 
  * Used by busy NUS students who want to organise their tasks for different modules
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _MODPRO_) used for tracking the progress of modules taken.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* It is named `MODPRO` because it was intended to help NUS students to track the progress of the modules taken.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[MODPRO Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-f11-2.github.io/tp)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org)
