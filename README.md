Mass Linkers is a powerful Desktop application tool that helps Computer Science (CS) students find study support from batchmates, making it easier to form study groups and look for module-related guidance.<br>

## Features
Mass Linkers provides the following features:
  * Save your CS batchmates’ module and contact details
  * Search for batchmates with common interests 
  * Search for batchmates who are taking or have taken similar modules


It is optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI).
