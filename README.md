InterNUS is a desktop app for managing internship applications, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, InterNUS can get your internship management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

* This is a brownfield project done by Computer Science students from NUS.
* It is named `InterNUS` because it was created for NUS students to manage their internship applications and contacts.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[InterNUS Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-f11-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook Level-3 project by the [**SE-EDU** initiative](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3/).
