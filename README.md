* This is a brownfield team project done by Software Engineering (SE) students.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _TrackAScholar_) used for managing scholarship applications.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[TrackAScholar Product Website](https://se-education.org/addressbook-level3)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org/).
