* This is **NotioNUS**, a desktop application built for students to track their tasks for modules in University.<br>
  Example usages:
  * Add new task under module CS2103T.
  * Mark a non-urgent tagged task under CS2100 as done/undone.
  * Filter tasks by module.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
* It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[NotioNUS Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-f12-3.github.io/tp/)**.
