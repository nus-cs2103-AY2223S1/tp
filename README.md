NUScheduler is a desktop app for managing contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, NUScheduler can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

For the detailed documentation of this project, see the [NUScheduler Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t17-3.github.io/tp/).

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
