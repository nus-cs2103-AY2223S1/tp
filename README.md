FoodWhere (FW) is a desktop app for managing food reviews, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). FW can get your tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps if you can type fast.<br>
  
**Example usages:**
  * add food stalls
  * add reviews for food stalls
  * list all food stalls stored in FoodWhere
  * list all reviews stored in FoodWhere

For more information on how to start using the application, check out the [User Guide](https://AY2223S1-CS2103-W14-2.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)
