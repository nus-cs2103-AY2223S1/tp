* This project is named `RC4 Housing Database` (`RC4HDB` for short). This is **a project created by NUS CS2103T Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* The project is designed to store and access information of the students residing in Residential College 4 (called _RC4 Housing Database_).
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* This is a brownfield project based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
