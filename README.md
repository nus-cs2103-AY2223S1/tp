# SoConnect
SoConnect is a desktop app for NUS SoC students to manage their contacts, optimised for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, SoConnect can get your contact management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps!ðŸš€âœ¨
