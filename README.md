## About The Project

* UniNurse is **a desktop app designed for private nurses to manage their patient contacts**, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, UniNurse can get your patient management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.
* The project simulates an ongoing software project, for the **CS2103T Software Engineering module** offered by the National University of Singapore.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[UniNurse Product Website](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t12-4.github.io/tp/UserGuide.html)**.
