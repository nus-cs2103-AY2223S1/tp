# Arrow

![Ui](docs/images/Ui.png)

* This is **a project made by Software Engineering (SE) students**.<br>
* The project simulates an ongoing software project for a desktop application used for managing contact details and project tasks.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.
  * It is named `Arrow` after the Singaporean slang term which means to delegate somebody to perform a task.
* For the detailed documentation of this project, visit the **[Arrow User Guide](https://ay2223s1-cs2103t-t08-2.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).
